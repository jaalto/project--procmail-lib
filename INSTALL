        Procmail is a tool to manipulate mail messages and this
        library includes many plug-in modules to be used from
        `~/.procmailrc'.

How to install

        Installation requires GNU make. The default location is
        /usr/local/share/procmail-lib for modules and
        /usr/local/share/doc/procmail-lib for documentation. Supply
        `prefix' and/or `exec_prefix' to make(1) call as needed. Note
        that the DESTDIR *must* be absolute path, because makefiles
	are run in their own directories.

            make prefix=/usr install

        To install for local account, use:

            make DESTDIR=$HOME prefix=/. install

How to sart using modules

       Put following near start of `~/.procmailrc':

            #  PM = Procmail, SRC = source files.
            PMSRC = /absolute/path/to/procmail-lib

        Any input parameters should be set before calling a module.
        Consult included documentation or read the comments at the
        beginning od each module file. Here is an example of using
        Unsolicited Bulk Email, aka spam, module:

            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-javar.rc  # Initalize variables
            INCLUDERC = $RC_UBE

            #  The "\/" records match to log file (if log has been activated)
            :0:
            * ERROR ?? ^()\/.+
            spam.mbox

Examples

        There are some examples of procmail setup files included under
        the documentation directory `examples/'.

Requirements

        Procmail Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) is needed before files in
        this library are useful. The Mail Transport Agent (MTA) must
        have been configured to support Procmail.

        Activating procmail for individual accounts may need setting
        up a `~/.forward' file. For more information, refer to manual
        pages procmail(1) and procmailrc(5) or contact local system
        administrator how to activate procmail support.

        Visit Procmail site <http://www.procmail.org> for wealth of
        documentation and the Prcocmail Documentation Project at
        <http://pm-doc.sf.net>.
