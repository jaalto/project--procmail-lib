        This page documents of part of the files included in Procmail
        Module Library project. Each modules is can be used as a plug-in.
        Some can be used as subroutines to your own programs and some are
        self containing recipes. There is no user or site specific settings
        in these modules.

        An attempt to minimize the use of external processes was the design
        goal. The modules try to use pure procmail way as much as possible
        e.g. to get date and directly from message without calling
        expensive shell `date'. It is important to remember that procmail
        is run on every incoming message and every CPU tick spent counts.

         Document control

        This document has been automatically generated from the procmail files
        with 2 small perl programs in the following manner:

            % perl -S ripdoc.pl `ls pm-ja*.rc|sort`   > pm-lib.raw

            % perl -S t2html.pl                                           \
              --html-frame                                                \
