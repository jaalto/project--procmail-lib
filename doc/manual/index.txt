        This page documents of part of the files included in Procmail
        Module Library project. Each modules is can be used as a plug-in.
        Some can be used as subroutines to your own programs and some are
        self containing recipes. There is no user or site specific settings
        in these modules.

        An attempt to minimize the use of external processes was the design
        goal. The modules try to use pure procmail way as much as possible
        e.g. to get date and directly from message without calling
        expensive shell `date'. It is important to remember that procmail
        is run on every incoming message and every CPU tick spent counts.

         Document control

        This document has been automatically generated from the procmail files
        with 2 small perl programs in the following manner:

            % perl -S ripdoc.pl `ls pm-ja*.rc|sort`   > pm-lib.raw

            % perl -S t2html.pl                                           \
              --html-frame                                                \

    Description

        This includerc extracts the various components of email address
        from variable `INPUT'. You can do quite a lot interesting things with
        your email address. One of the tricks that you could use if you
        don't have sendmail plus addressing capabilities, is that you put
        the additional infomation to the RFC comment. Eg. If you read and
        followup to posts in usenet games groups, you could use:

            From: <login@site.com> (John Doe+usenet.games)

        Or if your email address's localpart (that's characters before @)
        already signify your First and surname, you don't need to repeat it
        in comment. However, place special marker "+" to mark
        additional information part for your procmail recipes:

            From: <first.surname@site.com> (+usenet.games)

        The use of RFC comment should work everywhere because RFC requires
        that comments are preserved along with the address information.
        If you would have sendmail plus addressing capabilities you would
        have used:

            From: <login+usenet.games@site.com> (John Doe)

        The idea is that the list infomation is readily available from
        the email. The following recipe will derive the plus information
        and use it directly as a mailbox where to drop the message. If
        The Editor: Emacs, means anything to you, you can program it
        to generate the appropriate From headers automatically when you
        send mail from Gnus Mail/Newsreader MUA. Drop me a message if
        you need an example how a piece of Emacs lisp code makes those
        magic RFC plus addresses in the background while you compose the
        body of the message.

            RC_EMAIL = $PMSRC/pm-jaaddr.rc
            TOME     = "(login1|login2)"

            :0
            *$ ^TO\/.*$TOME.*
            {
                INPUT       = $MATCH
                INCLUDERC   = $RC_EMAIL
                PLUS        = $COMMENT_PLUS

                #  If COMMENT_PLUS was defined, we found "+"
                #  address which contain "usenet.games". Save it to
                #  folder.

                :0 :
                * PLUS ?? [a-z]
                $PLUS
            }

    Notes

        1998-05 David Hunt <dh@west.net> also mentioned that "you need to
        remember that some MTAs, (qmail for one, and soon vmail) use a dash
        ( - ) as the subaddress delimiter. So you'll want to allow for that
        in your code". For this reason the email part accepts both
        "-" and  "+". The RFC comment however accepts only "+" and "--".

    Example input

            "From: foo+procmail@this.site.com (Mr. foo)"        traditional
            "From: foo-procmail@this.site.com (Mr. foo)"        new styled

        NOTE: M$SOFT mailers tend to send idiotic smart quotes "'Mr. foo'"
        and this recipe ignores these two quotes ["'] as if message had
        only the standard ["]

    Returned values

            ADDRESS     "foo+procmail@this.site.com"
                        containing the email address without <>

            ACCOUNT     "foo+procmail"
                        all characters before @

            ACCOUNT1    "foo"
                        characters before plus: account1+account2@site
                        Note, if there is no "+", this is same as ACCOUNT.

            ACCOUNT2    "procmail"
                        _only_ set if plus found: account1+account2@site

            SITE        "this.site.com"
                        all characters after @

            DOMAIN      "site.com"
                        the main domain, preceding words in site are
                        considered subdomain (local) addresses.

                            sub.sub.domain.net

            SUB         "this.site"
                        all the sub-domain names without the NET part.

            SUB1        "site"
                        The first subdomain counted from the _RIGHT_ after NET

            SUB2        "this"
                        Second subdomain.

            SUB3        ""
                        Third subdomain.

            SUB4        ""
                        Fourth subdomain.

            NET         "com"
                        last characters after last period ( net,com,edu ...)

            COMMENT     Anything unside parenthesis (Mr. Foo) or if no
                        parentheses found, then anything between quotes
                        "Mr. Foo"

            COMMENT_PLUS Anything after the "+" in the comment, like
                         "Mr Foo+mail.usenet" --> "mail.usenet"

                         Note: some MTA's don't allow + character, so use
                         alternatively '--':
                         "Mr Foo--mail.usenet"  --> "mail.usenet"

        Additionally there is variables DOT1 DOT2, which behave like
        ACCOUNT1 and ACCOUNT2, but in respect to dotted firstname.surname
        type address:

                john.doe@site.com

                ACCOUNT1    = john.doe
                ACCOUNT2    = <empty>
                DOT1        = john
                DOT2        = doe

        If there is plus, the ACCOUNT2 is defined

                john.doe+foo@site.com

                ACCOUNT1    = john.doe
                ACCOUNT2    = foo
                DOT1        = john          (in respect to ACCOUNT1)
                DOT2        = doe           (in respect to ACCOUNT1)


        Variable ERROR is set to "yes" if INPUT wasn't recognized or parsing
        the address failed.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include pm-javar.rc from there.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

            INPUT = string-to-parse

    Usage example

        Read From field and address from it. This is lot faster than using
        external `formail' call.

            PMSRC   = $HOME/pm
            RC_ADDR = $PMSRC/pm-jaaddr.rc

            :0
            *  ^From:\/.*@.*
            {
                INPUT = $MATCH

                #  Turn off the logging while executing this part
                VERBOSE="off"   INCLUDERC = $RC_ADDR  VERBOSE="on"

                :0
                * ERROR ?? yes
                {
                   # Hmm, no std email address found. Any other ideas?
                }
            }

    Description

        Preserve last N arriving messages in a separate sub-directory.
        This should be your safety-belt recipe that you put to the beginning
        of your .procmailrc.

        Procmail saves the backup files with names like: msg.rcG  msg.scG
        msg.3YS1, msg.4YS1, msg.VYS1, msg.fYS1 to the backup directory.

        Note: this recipe will alawys call shell commands for each message
        you recive. That is needed because cleaning of the backup directory.
        If you receive only small number of messages per day, the performance
        drop of your .procmailrc is not crucial. But if you store many messages
        per day, then the shell calls may be a performance problem.

        In that case, consider moving the cleanup to the pm-jacron.rc
        module (The cleanup is run only once a day, not for every message)

        John Gianni send his simple bsckup script to Jari, who packaged
        and generalized the code. The code is reused with John's permission
        and maintaining responsibility was transferred to Jari

    Required settings

        (none)

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   JA_BUP_MAX, How many messages to keep at maximum. 32 is default
        o   JA_BUP_DIR, Where to store the messages. $HOME/Mail/bup by default
        o   JA_BUP_FILES, regexp to match the saved files. Procmail default.
        o   JA_BUP_CHECK_DIR. Once you have verified that this recipe works,
            that directories are ok, please set this flag to "no" to prevent
            running unnecessary `test' command for each email.

    Usage example

        You only want to keep backup of messages that are not from mailing
        lists. You may want to use TO_ macro to detect addresses better,
        this example matches against all headers

            LISTS          = "(procmail|list-1|list-2)"
            JA_BUP_DIR     = $HOME/Mail/backup/.        # Create the path too
            JA_BUP_MAX     = 42                         # this should be enough

            :0
            *$ ! $LISTS
            {
                INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jabup.rc
            }

        If you get many messages, please don't use this module. Instead
        see pm-jacron.rc where similar backup work is done better.

    Description

        When given a string, this subroutine returns a unique number
        representing a string, a cookie.

    Required settings

        (none)

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   INPUT, String from which the magic-cookie is calculated
        o   JA_COOKIE_CMD: shell command to read INPUT and return decimal
            or hex cookie string as one continuous block of characters.
            It decaults to HP-UX `cksum', but your system may have `md5'
            or `chksum'

    Return values

        o   Variable OUTPUT will contain the cookie.

    Example usage

            INPUT           = "foo@site.com"
            JA_COOKIE_CMD   = "md5"     # or chksum

    Overview of features

        o   Each user must register himself to cookie cache before he
            is considered "known"
        o   Unless user return the generated cookie string; which is
            typically a decimal or hex number, he is not considered as
            known and should not have access to services you provide.
        o   Can be used as a "doorbell" spam/UBE shield

    Description

        This recipe handles generating the cookie to new users, comparing
        the returned cookie against the original one and passing known
        users through if they already had returned their cookie.

        When you run automatised scripts, eg. to manage mailing lists
        where users can subscribe and unsubscribe, you have better to
        install safety measure so that someone can not subscribe his enemy
        to 30 mailing lists.

        The *cookie* is any continuous block of random characters that
        is sent to person who wanted to use the service. He must send
        back the *cookie* before the service starts an action, like
        subscribe. If someone forges the From address to pretend to be
        someone else and then subscribes as-beeing-someone-else to a
        mailing list, the cookie protects this from happening.

        The cookie is sent to someone-else, and he must return the cookie
        before the "subscribe" service is activated. Obviously this
        someone-else will not be interested in sending back the cookie and
        thus the forgery fails. Isn't that simple, but efective protection
        against misuse?

    Should I use this as Challenge-Response Spam shield?

        Unsolicited Bulk Email aka Spam is crawling from every possible
        domain thinkable, so you might think that a challenge-response
        policy could be deployed to regular email communication as well.
        The idea would be that unknown people are requested to
        "join" to a white list, before discussion is initiated with them.
        Bulk email shotguns do not reply to challenges (here: cookies),
        so confirmations are not returned. Individual people that want to
        talk, *may* want to return the cookies.

        Sounds like a perfect Unsolicited Bulk Email shield? No more
        non-invited mail? Wrong. Don't use this module for that. The
        whole idea of challenge-response is flawed and causes trouble
        for every person who tries to contact. Imagine for 10 people
        using C-R systems; they would all need to authenticate
        themselves. Who is going to believe that he is not replying to
        a spammer who is collecting email addresses? And what about
        automatic messages that might be received -- there is no
        artificial intelligence to deparate "human" messages from
        automatically generated messages, so challenges just
        increase the overall mail traffic. Every C-R system doubles
        the mail traffic and becomes spam problem by itself.

        In short, don't use this module for implementing a C-R system
        to block regular mail to you.

    How it works

        By default the cookie generated uses CRC 32 `cksum', but if you have
        md5, you should use it. The cookie is generated from the reply
        address and immediately stored to cookie database file with entry

            DATE FROM-a COOKIE-a
            DATE FROM-b COOKIE-b

        If this was a new user or an old user, who has not registered his
        cookie yet, then original message is sent back to the sender with
        instructions: "please place the magic string to Subject line and
        resent the message."

        When cookie is returned back, a new line to the database is added,
        simply by adding a duplicate entry. The file now looks like this:

            DATE FROM-a COOKIE-a
            DATE FROM-b COOKIE-b
            DATE FROM-a COOKIE-a

        When there is two or more same entries, like FROM-a, the address
        is supposed to be known and person behind it "cleared".

    Required settings

        o   pm-jastore.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   JA_COOKIE_SEND, flag. Default is "yes". Set to "no" if you want
            to take full control of the message returned to user. You can check
            variable `ERROR' and use `key' which holds the unique `cookie'
        o   JA_COOKIE_CACHE, cache to determine if this is new user or not.
        o   JA_COOKIE_AUTO_KEY, flag. If set to "yes"; the cookie is
            initially put to the Subject when the message is bounched back.
            Receiver only has to press "r" to reply to send the cookie
            and message back (convenient). You set this flag to "no" when
            you want to avoid accidnebts eg. when receiver is about to
            subscribe to a mailing lists: he has to manually insert the cookie
            into subject. But keep flag to "yes" if you use this module to
            get your friends registered easily.
        o   JA_COOKIE_KEYS, the cookie database. Email address and person's
            access cookie.
        o   JA_COOKIE_RC, dubroutine to generate the cookie id from INPUT.
            By default uses CRC 32.
        o   JA_COOKIE, the string from which the cookie will be generated.
            If you already have the return addres for the sender derived,
            you should assing a value to this to save unnecessary formail call.

    Returned values

        ERROR will contain the efective action when this recipe file ends

        o   "new-user", This is first message from sender.
        o   "known-user", message has email that has been "cleared" ie.
            cookie had been returned and user registered.
        o   "key-mismatch", This is at least second message from sender.
            But he dind't send the confirmation in this message.

        `key' is an internal variable in this recipe file and will hold the
        cookie id in case of "new-user" and "key-mismatch". You may want to
        use it if you generate your own reply.

    Example usage for UBE shield

        This is what I use to prevent unknown people from sending me UBE.
        It takes a bit extra, but they can easily return the message.
        Fill in the missing variables, this won't work out of the box for you.

    Description

        Framework for all cron tasks that can be run once a day.
        This is a wrapper recipe to your cron task list: when the day changes,
        you cron includerc is called.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This recipe
        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-jadate.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   JA_CRON_RUN_FLAG, You _must_ define this flag file.
        o   JA_CRON_DATE_FILE, File where the date information, last cron run,
            is kept. Defaults to $HOME/.yymmdd
        o   JA_CRON_RC, your includerc which is run when cron triggers.

        A file `JA_CRON_RUN_FLAG' which defaults to ~/.yymmdd.run is created
        when your includerc, that contains list of cron tasks, is run. If new
        mail arrives while your cron recipes are still running, you should
        prevent invoking the cron again by checking if this file exists.
        When all the cron tasks have been run, this flag file is removed.
        Remember to use "w" flag in your cron recipes where necessary
        to serialize the work.

    Return values

        (none)

    Usage example

        Save backups to separate directory, but do cleaning only once a day
        We do not keep backups from mailing list messages

            LISTS          = "(procmail|list-1|list-2)"
            BACKUP_DIR     = "$HOME/Mail/backup/."

            *$ ! $LISTS
            $BACKUP_DIR

            #   Run JA_CRON_RC once a day. It contains all daily cron tasks

            CRON_RC             = $PMSRC/pm-jacron.rc   # the framework
            JA_CRON_RC          = $PMSRC/pm-mycron.rc   # the tasks to do
            JA_CRON_RUN_FLAG    = $HOME/.cron-running   # define this!

            #   Do not enter here if message arrived at the same day when
            #   the cron is already running. The CRON_RC takes care
            #   of deleting the file when cron has finished.

            :0
            *$ ! ? $IS_EXIST $JA_CRON_RUN_FLAG
            {
                INCLUDERC = $CRON_RC
            }

        The *pm-jacron.rc* file may contain anything. For example to clean
        the backup directory; you add these statements there

            #   rm dummy: if ls doesn't return files, make sure rm has
            #   at least one argument.
            #

            #
            #   sed: chop $max newest files from the listing, leaving the

    Description

        When you send a message to a address that had delivery troubles,
        you get a DAEMON message back explaining the error problem. I
        usually want to save these daemon mesaages to a different folder
        and check the folder from time to time. A typical daemon message
        is like this (shortened)

            From: Mail Delivery Subsystem <MAILER-DAEMON@my.domain.com>
            Subject: Warning: could not send message for past 4 hours

            The original message was received at...
            ----- Transcript of session follows -----
            Deferred: Connection timed out
            ----- Original message follows -----
            [YOUR MESSAGE AS YOU SENT IT WITH HEADERS]

        Well, when I read the subjects, I do not like the standard error
        messages, but I also like to know to which address the delivery
        failed and what was the original subject. This small recipe changes
        the daemon message's Subject to

            Subject BRIEF-ERROR-REASON, SENT-TO-ADDRESS, ORIGINAL-SUBJECT

        and from that you can immediately tell if you should be worried Eg.
        if SENT-TO-ADDRESS was your friend's, then you want to take actions
        immediately, but if it were your complaint to UBE message to
        postmaster, you don't want to bother reading that daemon message.
        Here are some real examples:

            fatal errors,postmaster,ABUSE (Was: Super Cool Site!)
            Host unknown,postmaster,ABUSE (Was: A-Credit Information)
            undeliverable,postmaster,Could you investigate this spam
            Warning-Returned,friend,Have you looked at this

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        needs scrips

        o   pm-javar.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   `JA_DAEMON_SAVE'. This is by default `yes' which causes the
            original subject to be saved under header field `X-Old-Daemon-Subject'.
            If you don't want that extra header generated, set this variable to `no'
        o   `JA_DAEMON_REGEXP', which messages to trigger

    Return values

        o   Variable ERROR will be set to "yes" if daemon message was handled
            otherwise; value is "no"

    Usage example

        Just add this recipe somewhere in your .procmailrc. The place where
        you would put this daemon message trapper subroutine is crucial:
        think carefylly how you order your recipes. One suggested order
        could be: backup important messages, cron-subroutine,
        handle duplicates, DAEMON MESSAGES, plus addressed message,
        server message (file server, ping responder...), MAILING LISTS,
        send possible vacation  replies only after all above, apply
        kill file, detect mime, save private messages and las FILTER UBE.


            PMSRC           = $HOME/pm
            RC_DAEMON       = $PMSRC/pm-jadaemon.rc
            DAEMON_MBOX     = $HOME/Mail/junk.daemon.mbox

            ...

            INCLUDERC       = $RC_DAEMON

            :0 :            # If that was a daemon message, save it

    Description

        This includerc parses date from variable `INPUT' which has string

            "Week, Daynbr Month Year"

        Example input

            "Tue, 31 Dec 1997"      -- without comma
            "Tue 31 Dec 1997"       -- with comma

        Returned values

            YYYY    = 4 digits
            YY      = 2 digits
            MON     = 3 characters
            MM      = 2 digits

            ss      = 2 digits      If available
            TZ      = 5 characters  If available

        Variable ERROR is set to `yes' if it couldn't recognize the INPUT
        and couldn't parse the basic YYYY, YY, MM, DD variables.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include pm-javar.rc from there.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

            INPUT = string-to-parse

        The INPUT can have anything after "Week, dayNbr Month Year", or
        before it: you can pass a string like
        "Thu, 13 Nov 1997 11:43:23 +0200".

    Usage example

        The first *Received* header will tell when the message was received
        by your mailserver. We parse the date and avoid calling expensive
        `date' command.

            PMSRC           = $HOME/pm
            RC_DATE_WDMY    = $PMSRC/pm-jadate1.rc #Week-Day-Month-Year parser

    Description

        This subroutine calls shell command date once and prses the values.
        This should be your last resort if you haven't got the date values
        by any other means. This subroutine assumes that the DATE command
        knows the following % specifier formats (HP-UX)

            Y   NNNN    year
            h   MON     month
            d   NN      day
            a   WEEK    Like "Mon"
            H   NN      hour
            M   NN      min
            S   NN      sec

        Returned values

            DATE    = RFC date in format "Mon, 1 Dec 1997 17:41:09"
                      This is same as what you would see in From_

            YYYY    = 4 digits
            YY      = 2 digits
            MON     = 3 characters
            MM      = 2 digits
            DAY     = 3 characters
            DD      = 2 digits
            hh      = 2 digits
            mm      = 2 digits
            ss      = 2 sigits

        Variable ERROR is set to "yes" if values couldn't be set

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-jadate1.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        (none)

    Usage example

        The First Received line will tell when the message was received by
        the MDA. If thata fails, then get date from the system. If you send
        test messages to # yourself, you don't usually put From_ header in
        it and thus there is # no date information in 'dry run' tests.

            # Get time from first eader, which is always same in my system
            # Received: ... ; Thu, 13 Nov 1997 11:43:50 +0200

            INCLUDERC   = $PMSRC/pm-javar.rc    # to get $s $d definitions
            TODAY       # Clear it

            :0
            *$ ^Received:.*;$s+\/...,$s+$d.*
            {
                INPUT     = $MATCH
                INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jadate1.rc
                TODAY     = "$YYYY-$MM-$DD"
            }

            #   Check that variable did get set, if not then we have to call
            #   another date subroutine: Call shell then to find out date
            #
            #   You could also do this with ':0 E', but this is more
            #   educational

            :0
            *$ ! $TODAY^0
            {
                INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jadate4.rc    # Get date from Shell then
                TODAY     = $YYYY-$MM-$DD

    Description

        This includerc parses date from variable INPUT which has string

            "WeekDay Month dayNbr Year"

        Example input

            "Fri Jun 19 18:51:56 1998"      -- without comma
            "Fri, Jun 19 18:51:56 1998"     -- with comma

        Returned values

            YYYY    = 4 digits
            YY      = 2 digits
            MON     = 3 characters
            MM      = 2 digits
            DAY     = 3 characters
            DD      = 2 digits
            hh      = 2 digits      If available
            mm      = 2 digits      If available
            ss      = 2 digits      If available
            TZ      = 5 characters  If available

        Variable ERROR is set to "yes" if it couldn't recognize the INPUT
        and couldn't parse the basic YYYY,YY,MM,DD variables.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include pm-javar.rc from there.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

            INPUT = string-to-parse

        The INPUT can have anything after "Week, dayNbr Month Year", or
        before it: you can pass a string like
        "Fri Jun 19 18:51:56 1998 11:43:23 +0200".

    Usage example

        The first *Received* header will tell when the message was received
        by your mailserver. We parse the date and avoid calling expensive
        `date' command.

            PMSRC           = $HOME/pm
            RC_DATE_WDMY    = $PMSRC/pm-jadate5.rc #Week-Day-Month-Year parser

            # Get time from first header, it ends like this:

            :0
            *$ ()\/From .*
            {
                INPUT = $MATCH
                #  Turn off the logging while executing this part

                VERBOSE=off   INCLUDERC = $RC_DATE_WDMY   VERBOSE=on

    Description

    Usage Example

        For simple usage, just put this somewhere after backup recipes

                RC_DUP      = $PMSRC/pm-jadup.rc
                ...
                INCLUDERC   = $RC_DUP

        When you are testing messages, you send them over and over to
        .procmailrc; which means that same message should not be trapped by
        duplicate check. You can call `procmail' with option "-a test" which will
        set pseudo variable `$1'. The recipe below sets flag `JA_ID_IGNORE'
        to "yes" if test is on going and the duplicate filter should be
        bypassed.

            RC_DUP  = $PMSRC/pm-jadup.rc

            }

            #   Some microsoft product is known to send same message ids
            #   over and over. If we detect one, tunr off the duplicate test,

        usually use the returned value for logging purposes.

        Avoiding extra formail call could be usefull if you receive lot
        of messages per day.

        Returned values

            OUTPUT, containing the derived FROM field

    Required settings

    Overview of features

        o   Requires latest procmail (formail -z switch)
        o   You can send forward-on and forward-off control
            messages via email to control the forwarding in remote site.

    Description

        This includerc makes it possible to control your message forwarding
        via simple remote email message. Thanks to Era Eriksson and Timothy
        J Luoma who gave the initial idea to this forwarding module in the
        procmail mailing list 1997-10-07.

    Activating the forwarding by hand

        If you want to activate the forwarding from the local site where
        this module is, then you could simply write the forward address
        to the file pointed by *JA_FWD_FILE* which is `~/.forward-address'
        by default.

            % echo Me@somewhere.com > ~/.forward-address

        and when you no longer need forwarding, then remove that file.
        But really, this module is not used for that purpose, because it is
        lot easier to write

            :0
            ! Me@somewhere.com

        as a first statement in your .procmailrc when you want to forward
        your mail to another account.

    Activating the forwarding by remote email

        Suppose you're on the road and suddenly realize that you want your
        mail forwarded to the current account, then you send following
        control message

            Subject: forward-on password new-address@bar.com
            To: my-account@bar.com
            From: onTheRoad@some.com

        That message is is enough to get the mail forwarded to the address
        new-address@bar.com This script will respond to address From that
        the current forwarding is now pointing to address
        "new-address@bar.com".

    Deactivating forwarding by remote email

        The message is very similar, but the Subject header says

            Subject: forward-off password

        And no other fields are checked. Not even Reply-To. In this case
        the confirmation message is sent directly back to From address.

    Activating forwarding via body message

        If for some reason you have no control over the headers of email,
        eg when you send GSM-Mail message from your phone to your account:

            EMAIL foo@bar.com FORWARD-ON PASSWORD new-address@bar.com

        The email message looks like this:

            From: GenEmail <sms@FooBar.net>
            Date: Thu Sep 17, 11:42am +0200
            To:   "'Foo.Bar'" <foo@bar.com>
            Subject: Message 03384874987

            FORWARD-ON PASSWORD new-address@bar.com

        Instead of looking at the `Subject' field, you can get this module
        to look at the first words in the body field. See variable
        `JA_FWD_CONTROL_FIELD' which you want to set to "body".

    Restricting the control message aceptance

        If you only have persistent accounts, then you should set the
        *JA_FWD_FROM_MUST_MATCH* to match those addresses that you have.
        The following setting says that only control messages sent from
        these addresses are accepted. Nobody else can't change your
        forwarding settings.

            JA_FWD_FROM_MUST_MATCH = ".*(acc1@a.com|acc2@b.com)"

        Hm, that's not a bullet proof, because someone may in theory forge
        the From address. You probably should also set this variable to
        point to accounts where the mail can be legally forwarded to. Then,
        even if the imposter forges the From address; he can't get the
        email forwarded anywhere else than to the valid locations.

            JA_FWD_TO_MUST_MATCH = $JA_FWD_FROM_MUST_MATCH

        Consider also setting *JA_FWD_PASSWORD_CASE* to Procmail flag
        `D' which causes your control word "forward-on" and password
        to be case sensitive.

    Diagnostics

        If you don't receive confirmation message, then your control
        message was ill formed or you're not in the *JA_FWD_FROM_MUST_MATCH*
        list. There is no notification sent on failure, so that no attacker
        can draw conclusions.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc

    Installation

        You should preset all necessary variables prior adding the
        includerc command to your .procmailrc. Here is one simple setup

            #JA_FWD_SENDMAIL    = "tee $HOME/test.mail" # Uncomment if testing
            JA_FWD_COPY         = no    # no copies stored while forwarding
            JA_FWD_PASSWORD_CASE= "D"   # case sensitive
            JA_FWD_PASSWORD     = "MyMagicString"
            JA_FWD_FROM         = $FROM # This is already known.
            INCLUDERC           = $PMSRC/pm-jafwd.rc

    Comments from the author

        Please realise that when you set the forwarding from a remote site,
        be very carefull when you type in the forward address or your mail
        ends up to somebody else's mailbox. Also I recommend that you keep
        *JA_FWD_COPY* to *yes* so that your local account always keep the
        copy of forwarded message.

        A step further would conventionally encrypt(1)'ing your forwarded
        messages. This way even your top secret messages would be mostly safe
        even if they end up to someone else's mailbox.

    Description

        This subroutine tries to detect and derive the mailing list name as
        it appears in some of the known methods that ezlm, smarlist,
        listserv, majordomo etc. normally use. After this subroutine has
        been applied to message the variable `LIST' contains the mailing
        list name. Subroutine adaptively finds new new mailing lists
        from the messages.

        The alternative to subscribing to many mailing lists is to read
        them from web archives. Even better way is to use NNTP server at
        http://www.gmane.org which allows you to post as you would to a
        regular newsgroup. Consider using the NNTP interface and you may
        save you from receiving lot of messages that can already be found
        from Gmane's server.

    Quick start

        If you just want to jump in and use this module and you
        noteice that some list isn't trapped, please set

        o   JA_LIST_HEADER_REGEXP to match the From: field

        If you want to make some list more unique, like if name "Alert"
        was detected as a list name, please set

        o   JA_LIST_MAKE_UNIQUE to match the list name, like "Alert".
            After that the list name will be converted to HOST-LIST format.

    Sendmail plus type method for list subscription

        If you can use sendmail type PLUS addressing capabilities, you may
        not be interested in this module, because you have an alternative
        way to handle mailing list messages. The extra information after
        "+" is available to procmail scripts via `$ARG' pseudo variable
        when procmail is the LDA. Let's suppose you want to subscribe to
        procmail mailing list and want to save all messages to folder
        list.procmail, then you'd subscribe with address:

            login+list.procmail@site.com

        If your email host doe snot provide the plus addressing then it the
        traditiona approach have been to add a piece of recipe to
        `~/.procmailrc' to catch each list. But that's manual work for
        every list. When you use this subroutine, you no longer need to
        write separate mailing list recipes to your `~/.procmailrc' every
        time you subscribe to a new mailing list. The detection of a new
        list will happen automatically.

    What you need to know before using this module

        There is lot of heuristics going on in this module and one thing
        that you must note:

            If 'To:' domain is same as `From/Sender:/Reply-to:' domain
            then it is considered a mailing list message.

        This causes certain messages to be treated as mailing list messages.
        The module can't possibly know that the following is not from
        mailing list, because it doesn't know "what is mailing list", only
        "how it probably looks like it". This is definitedly categorized as
        mailing list message, because `From' and even `Reply-to' has the same
        domain `foo.bar.net' as in `To'.

            To: support@foo.bar.net
            From: message@foo.bar.net
            Reply-to: support@foo.bar.net
            Subject: Vmail See message to Eric

        You must prevent checking messages like this by surrounding call
        to this subroutine with a check statement:

            #   Do not check these messages

            noList = "From.*(foo.bar.net|support.my.com)"

            :0
            *$ ! $noList
            {
                INCLUDERC = $RC_LIST
                # ... save messsag by examining variable LIST (which see)
            }

    Ask for help

        If you find mailing lists that this subroutine does not detect, but
        which could have been detected by looking the headers in standard
        way, please send a email to maintainer. There may be cases where it
        is impossible to detect the mailing list and in those cases you
        just has to carve a new entry to your `~/.procmailrc'.
        When you keep your procmail log running, you may see message

             *** potential list ***

        Which is an indication that some new recipe could be added to
        to this subroutine to detect that mailing list. If the message
        you received _was_ from a mailing list, please send all the headers
        to the maintainer so that support can be added.

    Code note: Errors-To

        Bill Houle sent interesting headers which caused to add
        more heuristic than was feasible to solve the list detection.
        From the below headers it is practically impossible to derive the
        original list name. So, the list name is artificially constructed
        by combining Reply-To's LOGIN with Errors-To field's first host
        name

            Reply-To: news@doodle.foo.net
            Errors-To: bounced@doodle.foo.net

        The list name formed is "news-doodle". So, If you happen to see
        an odd name like this which doesn't remind the original list
        name, it may be due to poor headers that have no clue about
        the real name. No problem, check below how you would convert
        this name to better mailbox name.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will followign extra module, which must have been installed.

        o   pm-javar.rc

    Variable JA_LIST_FROM_TO_IGNORE

        This is regexp of sender addresses to ignore so that the if To and
        From are identical, it is not considered a list messages. This is
        typical for system generated messages that take form:

            From: root@host (Cron Daemon)
            To: root@host

    Variable JA_LIST_SAVE

        If set to "yes" then the list name information detected is saved to
        separate header. The `LIST_DETECTED' is the original grabbed word from
        the headers and the 'LIST' is the final name after possible
        list name conversions. According to RFC the X- can be user for
        user headers.

            X-List-Detected: $LIST_DETECTED mapped to $LIST

    Variable JA_LIST_KILL_POSTFIX

        If grabbed `LIST' match this regexp at the end of list name, then
        the postfix match will be removed. It is traditional that many
        list names are like list1-info, list2-beta, list3-L and ut would
        be preferable to see names like list1, list2 and list3. The
        default value will ditch "-(info|beta|L)".

    Variable JA_LIST_KILL_PREFIX

        Just like the postfix variable. If this string is matched at the
        beginning of the LIST, it is removed.

    Variable JA_LIST_DISREGARD_EMAIL

        In some cases this list detection recipe "thinks" that the address
        picked is the list sender. You may have a dedicated address where
        all you mailing list mails arrive and you have named it like
        mailing-list@me.here.at, which will effectively trigger: Ah,
        you have -list in email address, so this message must be from
        mailing list name 'mailing'. Of course it is not and you have to
        disallow the heuristics to make such assumption by defining a
        regexp that rejects a possible choice. For the above example, you
        would define:

            JA_LIST_DISREGARD_EMAIL = "posting-list@me.here.at"

        If you have several such addresses, just add them to the
        variable separating with normal regular expression "|" OR
        statement.

    Variable JA_LIST_HEADER_REGEXP

        This is *optional* variable, which you can set to match regexp of
        the mailing list domain address if it slipped through the tests
        in this module. There are some lists that send messages that don't
        carry enough information in headers to determine their list status.
        If you narrow the group by setting JA_LIST_HEADER_REGEXP, then for
        example lists like these, that identify themselves only through
        two headers, can be found:

            Reply-To: dispatch-faq@cnet.com
            From: CNET Digital Dispatch <dispatch@cnet.com>

        For that list you would set

            JA_LIST_HEADER_REGEXP = "(@cnet\.com)"

        Don't worry. all the other list detection recipes has already
        been tried, so this is last test that are carried out and variable
        JA_LIST_HEADER_REGEXP helps eliminating possible mishist

         You don't need set this variable to include all mailing list
         domains. Only to those ones that were not trapped. The default
         value for this is:

            "(amazon\.com|bookpool\.com)"

    Variable JA_LIST_MAKE_UNIQUE

        If you're subscribed to many mailing lists, that simply tell that
        they are *news* or *newsletter*, it will be impossible to
        differiantiate A *news* from B *news*. This variable holds regular
        expression that, if matched, prepend the first host name to the
        beginning of list name, thus making the list unique:

            news@some.com       --> some-news
            news@here.com       --> here-news

        The default value matches lists that contain word *news*, but you
        may need to set this to more matches.

    Variable JA_LIST_CONVERSION

            Note: before using this feature, make sure your `LINEBUF'
            is big enough, say 4096 or otherwise the variable's content
            is truncated.

        Many times the grabbed `LIST' name is not what you would like to
        use for your mailbox name. You want to make the name perhaps
        more shorter, more descriptive or categorize the messages according
        to hierarchy. Let's say that you have subscribed to following mailing
        lists:

            LIST            LIST name    Description of mailing list
            (as grabbed)    you want
            -------------------------------------------------------------
            jde             java.jde    Java Development Env
            java            java.lang   Java programming
            FLAMENCO        flamenco    Flamenco music
            tango-l         tango       Argentine Tango dancing
            tm-en-help      tm-en       Emacs TM mime package mailing list
            w3-beta         w3          Emacs WWW mailing list

        First, remember that the variable `JA_LIST_KILL_POSTFIX' is first
        applied, so the actual `LIST' appears as follows:

            jde, java, FLAMENCO, tango, tm-en, w3

        Ok, now we apply the conversion table by defining it as follows.
        The grabbed LIST name is first, then comes space(s), new name
        _and_ terminating colon. Repeat this for each list you want to
        convert.

            LIST CONVERSION[,LIST CONVERSION ...]

        This gives us table below: notice that entries tango-l, w3-beta
        were not included, because the `JA_LIST_KILL_POSTFIX' already got
        rid of the postfixes. Also note how the uppercase match FLAMENCO is
        converted to more suitable lowercase mailbox name. After you have
        set up this variable you can start saving messages to folders.

            JA_LIST_CONVERSION = "\
            jde       java.jde,\
            java      java.lang,\
            FLAMENCO  flamenco,\
            "

        The list conversion is done with pure procmail means, so it is very
        fast. It also means that the conversion is limited to FROM-STRING
        TO-STRING syntax. No wild cards or regular expressions are allowed.

          If you consider using an external process, like `sed' or `perl'
          to convert the grabbed list name to something else (when
          `JA_LIST_CONVERSION' method was not enough); think again. For
          each incoming mailing list message you launch external process.
          It is not unusual to receive 700 messages from various mailing
          lists a day, it can be imagined how much load any external
          process would add to the server. Use the grabbed mailing list
          name and `JA_LIST_CONVERSION' table if you care about system
          load.

        If you have many mailing lists that use uppercase names, it may be
        tedious to add each mailing list name to `JA_LIST_CONVERSION'.
        Possible alternative is to use very efficient `tr' program
        to convert characters to lowercase. Again; think twice,
        because any extra process could be avoided if `JA_LIST_CONVERSION'
        was used.

            :0
            * ! LIST ?? ^^^^
            {
                :0 D            # still uppercase list name?
                * LIST ?? [A-Z]
                {
                    LIST = `echo $LIST | tr A-Z a-z`
                }

                :0 :
                list.$LIST
            }

    List name is not always the same

        One important thing to keep in mind is that when mailing list
        manager sends out list messages, the headers may change.
        This means that the list name grabbed previously changes too.
        This is unfortunate, but it sometimes happens. Let's see an example.
        I was previously receiving messages from Cygwin mailing list named
        `gnu-win32'

            To: <gnu-win32@cygnus.com>, "Foo Bar" <foo@example.com>

        However, one day that same list was grabbed under name "cygwin", due
        to new header

            Mailing-List: contact cygwin-help@sourceware.cygnus.com; run by ezmlm
       Now I had two list names that both should be going to the same
        mailbox.  No worries, just add new entry to the translate
        table to convert the new list name to mailbox name:

            JA_LIST_CONVERSION = "\
            gnu-win32           cygwin32,\
            cygwin              cygwin32,\
            "

    Example: basic installation

        Here is recipe to save all your mailing list to separate folders.
        If you subscribe to new lists or unsubscribe to lists, you don't
        need to change anything. The grabbed list name will appear
        in variable `LIST'

            RC_LIST = $PMSRC/pm-jalist.rc   # name the subroutine

            ...

            #   Handle all mailing lists with one subroutine and recipe
            #   following it. Set also JA_LIST_CONVERSION before
            #   calling this subroutine to cnvert the found list names.

            INCLUDERC = $RC_LIST
            imap      =                 # Kill var. Set to "/" to enable

            :0                          # if list name was grabbed
            * LIST ?? [a-z]
            {
                dummy = "Saving mailing list: $LIST"

                :0 w:
                ${imap+".INBOX."}list.$LIST$imap
            }

        What's that IMAP thing there, you may wonder. Normally
        procmail delivers to standard mailbox, so the name is
        something like '$MAILDIR/list.abc'. For IMAP, the delivery
        must happen using principle "one file, one message", so
        procmail must deliver to a directory. That's what the added
        `$imap' is there for. It is also customary that IMAP folders
        are prefixed with ".INBOX", so the actual name becomes
        `$MAILDIR/.INBOX.list.abc'. For IMAP there should also
        be proper `MAILDIR=$HOME/Maildir' setting.

    Documentation

        The original father of the decoding scheme used here was
        presented by Peter Galbraith <galbraith@mixing.qc.dfo.ca> in
        procmail mailing list somewhere at the end of 1997.

        This subroutine supposes that the header has MIME header
        Content-Type: text/plain and performs quoted-printable or
        base64 decoding on the whole message. Note, that if you
        receive messages that have many mime attachments, then this
        recipe is not suitable for it.

        Procmail is *not* designed to handle mime attachments and this
        recipe only applies to whole _body_.

        The `pm-jamime-*.rc' is really stretching the limits and any
        serious works hould be delegated to appropriate Perl MIME modules.
        There is a Perl MIME module which will allow you to manipulate MIME
        body parts rather elegantly. See
        http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/Eryq/ for MIME-tools.

        Se also mimedecode at ftp://ftp.dde.dk/pub/mimedecode.c which
        in included in Debian Linux.

    Notes

        Perl or python is not used, because both are CPU intensive. It
        would be too expansive for accounts or environments receiving
        hundreds of mails
        per day (like from several mailing lists).

        RFC 2047 gives possiblity to use MIME iso-8859-1 extensions
        for mail headers.

            Subject: Re: [PIC]: RSA =?iso-8859-1?Q?encryption=B7=B7?=
            Subject: =?iso-8859-1?Q?=5BEE=5D:TV_&_video_IC=B4s_!!?=

        There is also base64 possibility (although rare):

            Subject: =?iso-8859-1?B?zvLi5fI6ICAgICAgTVBMQUIzLjQw?=

        In worst possible case there is even multiple ISO encoded
        strings in subject. Yes, this is valid, the continued line
        includes spaces at front to keep it with original just like
        in `Received:' headers. This subroutine will not touch headers
        that have multiple ISO tags - procmail is too limited for that.

        o   `JA_MIME_DECODE_TREAT_BODY', default "no". Decode
            body of message by removing quoted-printable from a
            message that contains only one part. Messages with multiple
            parts are not handled.

    Return values

        o    `PM_JAMIME_COMPLEX_SUBJECT' is set to "yes"
             if Subject header contains ISO encoding several times, it
             cannot be handled by this module. This flag is set to
             indicate that some other program shoudl handle the message.

    Examples

        Instead of testing the existence of text/plain in the body,
        you can force decoding by settings JA_MIME_DECODE_REGEXP to
        ".*".

            RC_MIME_DECODE = $PMSRC/pm-jamime-decode.rc

            :0
            * condition
            {
                JA_MIME_DECODE_REGEXP = ".*"
            }

            INCLUDERC = $RC_MIME_DECODE     # call subroutine.

    Description

            Note: If you think this module can do miracles, it cannot.
            MIME messages are very complex in structure and all this module
            can do is to detect *simple* attachements. It cannot be used
            as - all purpose - all detecting - MIME attachement killer.
            But the part it can do, is done efficiently, because most of the
            things are accomplished using procmail and resource friendly
            `awk'.

        There are meny programs that add additional information to the
        messages. Microsoft's mail program is one which may include
        a 7k application/ms-tnef attachment to the end of
        message. Many other programs may do the same. This was the idea
        in 1997 when this module was written; to get rid of the extra
        cruft which should not land in the mailbox.

        This recipe works like this: If email's structure is

            --boundary
            message-text (maybe quoted-printable)
            --boundary
            some-unwanted-mime-attachment
            --boundary

        then the attachment is killed from the body. The message-text part
        is also decoded if it was quoted printable. This leaves clean text
        with no MIME anywhere. MIME headers have will be modified as needed
        due to conversion from multi part and possibly quoted printable to
        plain text and the final  message looks like:

            message

        But if email's structure is anything else, like if there were 3
        mime sections:

            --boundary
            message-text (maybe quoted-printable)
            --boundary
            some-attachment
            --boundary
            some-unwanted-mime-attachment
            --boundary

        then the "unwanted" part is emptyed by replacing with one empty
        line. The message structure stays the same, but the killed
        "some-unwanted-mime-attachment" part is labelled as text/plain
        so that the MUA (Mail User Agent; the email reader program)
        can decode the MIME message correctly.

    Applications for other mime attachments

        The following cases are ncluded on in this module. You need to
        separately the behavior before this module will start working.

        o   Lotus Notes attachment.
        o   Microsoft Express attachement. It sends a copy of message in HTML
            format.
        o   Mozilla's Netscape attachement. It sends a copy of message in HTML.
        o   `Vcard' attachments.
        o   Openmail attachment. It sends 10-20 line base64 attachments
            WINMAIL.DAT.

    Example of lotus notes attachment

    Required settings

        To handle base64 encoded messages, package called `metamail' must
        have been installed to system. It provides program `mimencode'
        which is used through variable $MIME_BIN (see pm-javar.rc).

        Variable $PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code.
        This subroutine will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-jamime.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        First of all, this is primarily a framework recipe to kill any kind
        of attachment. If you do not set `JA_MIME_TYPE' before calling
        this recipe, recipe will try to determine the right value by itself.
        If the automatic detection fails you _need_ to preset the value
        of `JA_MIME_TYPE' beforehand.

        o   `JA_MIME_TYPE' is a case sensitive AWK *REGEXP*. Always use
            *lowercase* letters in this regexp because the line is lowercased
            before match is made. This regexp determines if the kill
            recipe is applied to the message or not. Value is set for
            MS explorer, MS express, Netscape and Lotus Notes etc.
            messages by default.
        o   `JA_MIME_KILL_RE', additional *REGEXP* to kill lines from the
            message. Value is case sensitive awk regexp and by default matches
            Lotus notes tag: name="XXX.PCX".
        o   `JA_MIME_EXTRA_HEADER', name of header added to the message
            if the MIME portion was killed. Default value is
            "X-Mime-Type-Killed".

        It may be possible that some messages are malformed and that
        they do not contain proper "boundary" definition string in the
        header. There have been messages that have text/html
        attachments, but no proper Mime headers. For those cases there
        is additional variable that will kill all text up till
        matching line regardless of message content.

        o   `JA_MIME_KILL2_RE' is set to "text/html|application/ms-tnef".
            Update this to match attchements you receive. Set variable to
            "" if you don't want to change the body of non-compliant MIME
            message.

        That variable is the last resort if the standard MIME detection
        failed. There must have been some problem in the sender's MUA that
        composed message. It's dangerous, so make sure you don't set it
        lightly.

    Possible conflict with your awk

        If you see an error message in the log file saying that awk failed:

            procmail: Executing awk,
            ...
            procmail: Error while writing to "awk"
            procmail: Rescue of unfiltered data succeeded

        it means that the system's standard `awk' doesn't support the
        variable passing syntax. Do the following test:

            % awk '{print VAR; exit}' VAR="value" /etc/passwd

        It should print "value". If not, then see if you have `nawk' or
        `gawk' in the system. They should understand the variable passing
        syntax. The only change needed is to define variable AWK
        somewhere at the top of `~/.procmailrc'.

            AWK = "gawk"        # Better than standard "awk"

    Warnings

        You should know that the variable `JA_MIME_KILL_RE' is used to wipe
        any lines that match that regexp. This is due to MIME structure
        where continuing header lines exist in the body:

            ------=_NextPart_000_003A_01BD16E2.C97E27B0
            Content-Type: text/plain;
                charset="iso-8859-1"                << kill this line too

        If you want to be absolutely sure that anything valuable won't be
        accidentally killed (like a code line in programming language scripts),
        you should set this variable to nonsense value that newer matches:

            JA_MIME_KILL_RE = "match_it_never_I_hope"

    Usage example: Customizing the attachment killing

        Suppose you receive new `application/ms' type attachment that the
        default settings doesn't cover. This is a new mime type and you
        have to instruct this module to kill it. Add this and similar
        tests for other mime types:

            myCustomMimeType = "application/ms"     # must be all lowercase

            :0
            *$ $myCustomMimeType
            {
                PM_JA_MIME_TYPE = $myCustomMimeType
            }

            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jamime-kill.rc

    Usage example

        To kill text/html or pdf, postscript and others add something
        like this to `~/.procmailrc'. It demonstrates how the correct
        MIME types are detected:

            # .....................................................
            # 1) Uncomment following line if your standard "awk" is broken

            # AWK = "gawk"

            # .....................................................
            #  2) Set correct value for attachment killing

            :0
            * ^X-Lotus-FromDomain:
            {
                #  Kill Lotus notes .pcx attachments
                JA_MIME_TYPE = "application/octet-stream"
            }

            :0
            * H ?? ^From:.*foo@example.com
            * B ?? ^Content-Type:.*text/html
            {
                #   Kill html attachments
                JA_MIME_TYPE = "text/html"
            }

            # .....................................................
            #  3) Call module

    Documentation

        This includerc reads MIME boundary string from the message
        if it exists. The boundary string is typically found from
        Content-Type header.

            Mime-Version: 1.0
            Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=9i9nmIyA2yEADZbW

        In addition it will define few other mime variables. See the
        returned values. You use these variables later in your MIME
        message processing.

    Mime Notes

        1998-07-28 Brett Glass <brett@lariat.org> reported in PM-L that
        there was security exploit in long attachment filenames:
        http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1998-07/msg00248.html

        And here is the url to the matter:

        http://www.sjmercury.com/business/microsoft/docs/security0728.htm


        When you use this module to detect mime messages, you can check the
        filename length with recipe:

            #  Recipe after calling $RC_MIME, this module,

            re       = ".........."     # regexp with 10 matches
            too_long = "$re$re$re$re"   # allow 40 characters maximum

            :0
            *$ $SUPREME^0  MIME_H_ATTACHMENT ?? $re
            *$ $SUPREME^0  MIME_B_ATTACHMENT ?? $re
            {
                dummy = "** Dangerously long mime attachment filename"
                dummy = "** $MIME_H_ATTACHMENT $MIME_B_ATTACHMENT"

        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        (none)

    Return values

        o   Variable MIME is set to "yes" or "no" if messages has mime version
            string
        o   MIME_VER contains the mime version string from the header.
        o   MIME_TYPE contains the Content-Type from the header.
        o   MIME_CTE contains Content-Transfer-Encoding from the header.
        o   MIME_H_QP is "yes" if Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
            is in the header.
        o   MIME_B_QP is "yes" if Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable
            is found from the body.
        o   MIME_BOUNDARY contains the boundary string, which is used to
            differentiate mime sections in the body.
        o   MIME_BOUNDARY_COUNT is the number of boundary strings found
            from the body. The value is 3 if there is two mime sections,
            and 4 if 3 etc. MIME_BOUNDARY_COUNT -1 = count of sections.
        o   MIME_H_ATTACHMENT, contains the filename if there was attachement
            filename in the header. Content-Disposition: attachment;
            filename="..."
        o   MIME_B_ATTACHMENT. `body' file attachment. Note however that
            this is the match of first string in the body. There may be
            several attachments. MIME_B_ATTACHMENT_FILE_COUNT tells you
            how many filenames are in the body.

        *From* headers back to quoted printable format so that
        messages can be savely saved through IMAP system which may not
        handle 8-bit messages. If message is stored directly to
        mailbox and the used Mail user Agent has no problems with
        dealing 8-bit characters, this module is not needed.

        An example where this subroutine could be applied:

        o   Feed message to `pm-jamime-decode.rc'
        o   Feed message `pm-jasubject.rc' (to clean multiple Re: Re: Fwd ..)
        o   Restore From/Subject encodings with `pm-jamime-recode.rc'
        o   Save message to mailbox

    Notes

        Perl or python is not used, because both are CPU intensive.
        It would be too expansive for accounts or environments
        receiving hundreds of mails per day (like from several mailing
        lists).

    Required settings

        Variable `PMSRC' must point to source directory of procmail code.
        This subroutine will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-jamime.rc
        o   Program `$MIME_BIN_QP_E'
            must have been installed (see pm-javar.rc).
        o   pm-jamine-decode.rc must have been called and message must
            contain headers `X-Mime-Header-Decoded-*'

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   `JA_MIME_RECODE_TREAT_SUBJECT', default "yes". Decode
            Subject header by removing mime.
        o   `JA_MIME_RECODE_TREAT_FROM', default "no". Decode
            From header by removing mime.

    Return values

        (none)

    Examples

        To fix Subject header and then make it 7bit clean again. Note,
        this may not be exactly what you want. The pm-jamime-decode.rc
        file does a little more than  From/Header handling (also modifies
        message body). Read documentation of each file before using
        following example

            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jasubject.rc
            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jamime-decode.rc
            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jamime-recode.rc

    Documentation

        This module saves _one_ simple file attachment (MIME) from he
        message. The message must define following MIME headers. If
        "filename=" does not exists, then the message is ignored.

            Mime-Version: <version>
            Content-Type: <type>
            Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="file.txt"

        The last line can also be in separate line, provided that it
        is indented according to standard rules:

            Mime-Version: <version>
            Content-Type: <type>
            Content-Disposition: attachment;
                filename="file.txt"

        Procmail is not very suitable for saving MIME attachments and
        you should not think that this the right tool for you.
        If you receive anything more than 1 attachment, this recipe
        does nothing, because that's out of our league and you need some
        more heavy weight mime tools. E.g. Perl CPAN has MIME libraries.

        _Note_: when the attachment is in the body, it is simply written
        to a disk and the location in message is replaced with test:

            Extracted to file:/users/foo/junk/<YYYY-MM-DD-hhmm>.file.txt.

        The existing mime headers that surround the attachment are
        lect untouched, so don't try to press your Mail Agent's MIME buttons
        at that point. There is no such file in that spot
        if you set `JA_MIME_SAVE_DEL' to `yes'.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This
        subroutine includes library:

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-jamime.rc
        o   pm-jamime-decode.rc
        o   pm-jadate.rc (which will call other pm-jadate*.rc files)

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   `JA_MIME_SAVE_DIR', point this to directory where you
            want to store attachments.
        o   `JA_MIME_SAVE_DECODE', set this to "yes", if you want that
            attachment is decoded before written to disk. This usually
            opens quoted printable or base64 encoding.
        o   `JA_MIME_SAVE_DEL', set this to "yes", if you want to remove
            the attachment from the body of the message after it has
            been filed. Be vary careful if you use this option. If you
            keep backup cache of incoming mail, then you might try "yes".
        o   `JA_MIME_SAVE_OVERWRITE', set this to "yes" if it's okay to
            overwrite to an existing filename found from attachment.
            If you get periodic attachments always with same name, then
            you would want to set this to yes.

    Core dump note

        Because procmail uses LINEBUF when filtering messages, a core
        dump may happen if the attachment being filtered is bigger than
        the LINEBUF. The current setting accepts 524K attachments, but if
        you expect to get bigger than that, you want to increase
        `JA_MIME_SAVE_LINEBUF'.

    Possible conflict with your awk

        Awk is used because it is much more system load friendly than perl.
        If you see an error message in the log file saying that awk failed:

            procmail: Executing awk,
            ...
            procmail: Error while writing to "awk"
            procmail: Rescue of unfiltered data succeeded

        it means that the system's standard awk doesn't support the
        variable passing syntax. To verify that this is the case, run
        following test:

            % awk '{print VAR; exit}' VAR="value" /etc/passwd

        The proper awk should print "value". If not, then see if you have
        `nawk' or `gawk' in your system, which should understand the
        variable passing syntax. To change the AWK, you need to set
        following variable somewhere at the top of your *.procmailrc*

            AWK = "gawk"        # if that works better than standard "awk"

    Return values (none)

    Description

        ** THIS MODULE IS OBSOLETE. THE NETMIND SERVICE NO LONGER EXISTS **

        http://minder.netmind.com/

        ...Netmind, or The URL-minder is a free, automatic Web-surfing robot
        that keeps track of changes to Web pages that are important to you.
        When the URL-minder detects changes in any of the Web pages you
        have registered, it sends you e-mail. an effective way to test if
        the address is known to Internet. You could use this information to
        see if some automated reply to a address can be sent.


        In another words, if you're interested in some URL; say an FAQ page
        and any updates to them, you can tell Netmind to monitor the page
        changes for you and it send a message back every time page changes.

        This recipe "pretty formats" the announcement sent by Netmind
        by stripping the message to bare minimum. You usually aren't interested
        in 4k message which includes "Note from our sponsors", "Try the free
        online demo" etc. The things saved from the announcement message are:

        o   The changed url, which is moved to subject
        o   Cancellation url pointer
        o   url to the lists of your monitored urls
        o   your id number

        [Note]

        Please let Netmind send you one "pure" message first so that you
        have a huch what it originally looks like. Then plug int his module
        and see how the original message is reduced.

        [Thank you]

        The Doctor What <docwhat@holtje-christian-isdn.mis.tandem.com>
        1998-03-12 send me a patch, where a)body message is more informative
        b) URL is now included in the body for auto-click browsers c)
        mime headers were removed.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   If you se variable JA_NETMIND_SUBJECT to "yes", then the changed
            url http pointer is put to subject line.

    Usage example

            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-janetmind.rc          # reformat the message

            :0:                                         # drop to folder

        <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>.

    Description

        This subroutine runs `nslookup' on given INPUT address. This may be
        an effective way to test if the address is known to Internet. You
        could use this information to determine if some automated reply to
        a address can be sent. The know truth is that you can't validate
        whole email address

                to_someone@foo.com

        but you can validate "foo.com"; that's the closest you get.

        [Warning: If you don't use cache feature...]

        Do not however use this module to regularly check _all_ incoming
        from addresses with this subroutine for possible bogus UBE
        addresses, because calling nslookup

        o   may be slow, building to connection and querying the results
            may take several seconds. (some times, usually it's quote fast)
        o   consumes quite a lot resources.

        You can however check _some_ messages that are likely UBE to verify
        your doubts.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-jaaddr.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   INPUT, the address (only strict domain part) which is checked.
            Eg. "this.domain.com". See examples for more.
            If this string contains "@" character, then additional
            subroutine pm-jaaddr.rc is called to extraxt the domain name
            INPUT = "John Doe <foo@site.com>" --> INPUT = "site.com"
        o   JA_NSLOOKUP_CACHE, filename. If exists, cache is used and updated.
        o   JA_NSLOOKUP_FORCE, if "yes", then cache is not used but a forced
            nslookup is performed.
        o   JA_NSLOOKUP_OPT, is currently empty, but you could see if you
            you want to use "-querytype=MX". However this option may give
            you response: "No mail exchanger (MX) records available",
            which is flagged as nslookup failure.
        o   JA_NSLOOKUP_SERVER, optional, the server to user for nslookup

        If the cache file can be read:

        o   Each entry has format "address.com ns-error". The error
            indication is added to the line if the nslookup failed when
            address was checked. Otherwise line contains "address.com".
        o   The cache is always checked first. If there is no entry matching
            the current address, only then is nslookup called and new entry
            added to cache.

    Return values

        o   Variable ERROR will be set to "yes" if nslookup failed or
            to "no" if nslookup succeeded. It can also contain "maybe" if
            nslookup returned "No address (A) records available"
        o   ERROR_MATCH contains one line lookup failure reason.

        Following conditions trigger "maybe" and no "ns-error" is written
        into the cache.

        o   "No address (A) records available for xxx"

    Usage example

        If you are going to check some header field, like From:, please
        explode the content with pm-jaaddr.rc first. Suppose you have
        string:

            "From: foo@ingrid.sps.mot.com (Yoshiaki foo)"

        You have to derive the address from string and pass the site name:
        Read From: field and address from it.

            PMSRC       = $HOME/pm
            RC_NSLOOKUP = $PMSRC/pm-janslookup.rc   # name the subroutine

            :0
            * MAYBE_UBE ?? yes
            * ^From:\/.*
            {
                INPUT       = $MATCH
                INCLUDERC   = $RC_NSLOOKUP  #   to nslookup

                :0
                * ERROR ?? yes
                {
                    #   Hm, nslookup failed, can't send anything back to this
                    #   address
                }
            }

        Second example, check if the address is reachable before sending reply

            INPUT       = `$FORMAIL -rt -x To:`
            INCLUDERC   = $RC_NSLOOKUP

            :0
            *    ERROR ?? no
            {
                # okay, at least site address seems to be reachable
            }

    Documentation

        This subroutine digs embedded message from the body and replaces
        current message with it. Copy the message to folder before calling
        this subroutine if you need original.

        NOTE: This is _simple_ tool and the sole purpose is to derive
        simple embedded messages. Write full fledged perl script if you
        want better extracting features. The used AWK inside this procmail
        recipe will fail to find 30% of the cases, mostly due to non-standard
        way of including the message. The recognized formats are as follows.
        Anything that differs from these are ignored or incorrectly parsed.

        o   Message is embedded left flushed "as is". With full headers or
            Minimum of `From:' `Subject' `Received'
        o   The embedded message is quoted with `>' with optional _one_
            space.

    Where you would use this module

        If you're subscribed to mailing lists that regularly sent copies of
        original message to the list, like forwarding spam to SPAM-L
        mailing list at http://bounce.to/dmuth, then you'd like to
        extract the original embedded message which you can then feed to
        your UBE filter to test if the shield holds.

            <spam-l-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com>
            subscribe SPAM-L <First name> <Last name>

        This recipe takes simplistic approach and tries it's best to
        extract embedded message. Idea for this recipe comes from Era
        Eriksson's posting "recipe to turn list postings back into original
        spam" 1998-06-25 in Procmail mailing list.

        o   Body must contain headers
        o   Remove all `>' quotations.
        o   extract everything to the end of message. (There are no means
            to get rid of the attached signatures that ot forwarding poster
            or list server may have attached.

    How the message is extracted

        When this recipe ends, the current message has been modified so that
        it _is_ _the_ _original_ _message_. Like if you would receive:

            HEADER-1        # The poster
            body-1          # his comments
            HEADER-2        # The original embedded message
            body-2
            body-1          # And poster's signature or mailing list footer

        The message now looks like

            HEADER-2
            body-2
            body-1

        And you can save this as original message or feed it to your
        UBE filter and test if it detects it.

    Code note: procmail or awk core dump

        For some reason procmail kept dumping core I write the code in
        more nicer format like below, but if I made it compact, then it
        didn't dump core. Go figure. I'm not pleased that I had to sacrafice
        clarity, but there was no other way.

            [The good style]            [The forced compact style]
            if ()                       if () { statement }
            {
                statement
            }

        I have no explanation why this
        happens, the same AWK code would work just fine most of the cases and
        then came this message `x' and caused dumping the code, if I feed
        some other message, I didn't get core dump. Total mystery to me.
        Don't let the log message fool you, this had nothing to do
        regexp  "^[> ]*From:.*[a-zA-Z]". If I deletd one line from AWK
        script, it worked ok, if I added it back the core dump happened with
        that message `x'

            procmail: Assigning "pfx=[> ]*"
            procmail: No match on "^[> ]*From:.*[a-zA-Z]"
            Segmentation fault (core dumped)

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail includerc code.
        This subroutine needs module(s):

        o   pm-javar.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        (none)

    Usage Example

        Let's assume that you want to feed all forwarded UBE that is
        posted to spam-l mailing list to your filter and see if it needs
        improving by checking the logs later. The forwarded UBE to the list
        is labelled "SPAM:" in the subject line.

            $RC_LIST = $PMSRC/pm-jalist.rc   # mailing list detector
            $RC_ORIG = $PMSRC/pm-jaorig.rc   # extract original
            $RC_UBE  = $PMSRC/pm-jaube.rc    # UBE filter

            ...

            INCLUDERC = $RC_LIST            # defines variable `LIST'

            :0
            * ! LIST ^^^^
            {
                :0                          # spam-l mailing list
                * LIST ?? spam
                * Subject: +SPAM:
                {
                    INCLUDERC = $RC_ORIG    # Change it to UBE message

                    #   Ok, next feed it to filter, set some variables first
                    #   Log = Short log; What filters were applied to message
                    #   mbx = If message was trapped, save it here

                    JA_UBE_LOG      = "$PMSRC/pm-ube.log"

    Description

        When I'm on remote site and I don't seem to get throught
        with telnet or even with Unix ping(1), I want to know if the
        at least the mail server is up. I can send a ping message and the
        auto responder will reply immediately.

        Sometimes, when you send a message to a person, it would be nice,
        if you could test that the destination address is valid, before
        sending a message to a black hole. If the receiver had ping
        service running; like this, then you would know that you spelled the
        the right address. (after wondering two weeks; why you don't get
        response). Nowadays `finger(1)' command seems to be blocked many times.

        This recipe answers to simple ping message like this:

            To: you@site.com
            Subject: ping

        Recipe sends a short message back to the sender.

    Description

        Ahem, that `pop3' is just to draw your attention. This module has
        nothing to do with pop3. The idea may resemble it though. This
        module listens pop3 requests, and when it gets one, it sends
        the whole mailbox content as separate forwarded messages to the
        account from where you sent the request.

        This is kinda "empty my mailbox in account X and send the messages
        to account Y"

        You might have permanent forwarding on in account X, but if that
        is your secondary account, you can ask what messages has been arrived
        there with this recipe.

        After you have configured your magic pop3 command, which is your
        password, simply send a message to account X, and this module
        initiates emptying the mailbox. Here is an example:

            Subject: pOp3-send [mailbox] [kill]

        o   `mailbox', is optional folder name which you want to process.
            it is $DEFAULT if not given in subject. Use *absolute* path if
            you specify one.
        o   if word `kill' is found, the mailbox will be emptied after
            forwarding. If the word is not found, messages are preserved.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-japop3.rc            # Phew! We include ourself, we are recursive.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   `JA_POP3_SUBJECT_CMD' is your personal access command string.
            If this is the first word in the subject line, forwarding starts.
            This string is case sensitive.
        o   `JA_POP3_TMP' is the file where mailbox is moved before starting
            to forward the messages. Do not put to point to your $HOME,
            becaus that may exceed the quota.
        o   `JA_POP3_TO_MUST_MATCH' must contain regexp that match the email
            addresses where the pop3 messages are allowed to send. BE SURE
            TO DEFINE this. If you have account X,Y,Z where you want to receive
            pop3 messages, set this regexp to match those site's email addresses.
        o   `JA_POP3_LOGFILE' is the log where you can see how the forked
            procmail processes send each pop3 mail. You may want to set this
            to different location than your default `$LOGFILE'.

    Return value

        `STATUS' will contain mailbox name if valid pop3 request was received.
        You may wish to save the pop3 requests to separate folder. See example
        below.

    Example usage

        You install this same setup for each site where you have account. This
        is the account X, from where you want to empty the mailboxes.

            RC_POP3             = $PMSRC/pm-japop3.rc

            .. somewhere in your .procmailrc ..

            JA_POP3_SUBJECT_CMD = myPoPcmd
            INCLUDERC           = $RC_POP3

            #   Save all pop3 requests to folder

            :0 :
            * STATUS ?? [a-z]
            mail.pop3-req.mbox


    In account Y, from where you send the pop3 requests. Following code stores
    The received messages to separate folder

            #   The MATCH will contain the host name from where the messages
            #   were moved

            :0 :
            *$ X-Loop-Fwd:.*\.rc +\/$NSPC+
            mail.fwd.$MATCH.mbox

    Description

        Return random line or a line from a file. This subroutine uses
        shell command `awk' and possibly `wc' to be as small burden to the
        system as possible.

    Required settings

        You must have awk that supports VAR=value assignment syntax outside
        the code block: that is, in the input line. I know no awk that
        would not have this feature, but at least you know now what it takes.

            % awk '{print VAR; exit;}' VAR=1 /etc/passwd

        Try using GNU awk, if your standard awk didn't print 1 in above
        test. (Put this line to the top of your .procmailrc)

            AWK = "gawk"

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        If intend to call this subroutine many times, then please calculate
        the number of lines beforehand and pass it to this subroutine. If
        the MAX is not set, then `wc' is called every time to find your the
        line count.

        o   FILE, from what file to select. Make sure this exists; existence
            is not checked here.
        o   [MAX] optional, number of lines in the FILE.

    Returned value

        variable LINE

    Example usage

            # Select random line from a file

            $RC_RANDF = $PMSRC/pm-jarand.rc
            $COOKIE   = $HOME/txt/cookie.lst

            ...somewhere..
            MAX=20 FILE=$COOKIE    INCLUDERC=$RC_RANDF

    Description

        This is the MPFS (Mime Procmail File Server) and it can send MIME
        compliant messages with command

            "send <ITEM> [WORD1] [WORD2]"

        Usually only the ITEM arg is used, and the rest of the words are for
        special uses like password and preventing file encoding. A typical
        request looks like:

            Subject: send help              # ask for file named 'help'

    Overview of features

        o   MIME types gzip and text/plain are supported.
        o   .gz .zip etc. files are sent out as base64 attachments
        o   .gz .tar.gz files that exceed 100K are sent out as MIME multiparts
        o   requires procmail 3.11+ and MATCH operator \/
        o   requires `mmencode' and `gzip' executables to be present in PATH.

    Install: server file directory

        You have to create a directory for the server where the files are kept.
        Usually I don't put the files there, but whenever I want to make a
        file available, I draw a hard or softlink to the real file.

            % mkdir $HOME/pm-server

            # Repeat this as needed for files you want to put available

            % cd $HOME/pm-server
            % ln -s $HOME/txt/interesting-file.txt interesting-file.txt

        You define the server directory by setting

            JA_SRV_FILE_DIR = $HOME/pm-server

        The short server log is written to file pointed by this variable:

            JA_SRV_LOG = $HOME/pm-server.log

        The incoming "send" requests are stored to mailbox pointed by
        following variable. The default value is /dev/null, but
        you may want to set it to ~/Mail/spool/log.srv.spool which can be
        used read as a newsgroup by Emacs Gnus [In Gnus create newsgroup with
        `G` `m' `nnml' `log.srv']

            JA_SRV_MSG_MBOX

    Install: special files

        Tweak this variable to commands you want to allow shell to execute
        in server's directory. This tells when <ITEM> "ls" means command
        instead of file

            JA_SRV_SH_COMMAND = "^(ls|what)$"

        That means that request like this:

            Subject: send ls            # run "ls" command and return results

        Be sure that the commands exist in your system. See man pages for
        more if you want to know what these commands do. Commands cannot
        take switches currently for security reasons. E.g. if you want to
        give access to "ls -la" listing, put a file "ls-la.txt" available
        in the directory, user can get it with "send ls-la.txt"

            ls      -- list directory
            file    -- print file type information.
            what    -- prints all @(#) tags from files
            ident   -- print all $ $ tags from files

    Install: file `help'

        Users want to get a help file with message "send help" and the
        `help' is just a file in your server directory. Be sure to supply it
        prior to any other files. You can always draw a link to a file if you
        don't want to name it that way (e.g. if you keep several server help
        files in a RCS tree)

            #   draw symlink to `help'

            % ln -s $HOME/txt/srv-public-hlp.txt $HOME/server/help

    Basic usage in details

        The server accepts command in format

            "send <ITEM> [CMD|PASSWORD]"

        Where ITEM can be any name as long as it starts with [^ .]. The
        regexp says: Anything goes as long as FILE does _not_ start with
        space or period. This gives you quite a much freedom to construct
        filenames. if you want to hand out file:

            .procmailrc

        You can't. Instead make a link to point to plain "procmailrc"
        without the leading period. There is also additional checks
        against possible security threat "../" like below; user can't
        request such file.

            ../../../gotcha  or  dir/../../gotcha

        The filename cannot contain special characters like [*?<>{}()].

    Advanced usage

        [conversions]

        If some of your files are big, it makes sense to send them in
        compressed base64 format; which in MIME world is called content-type
        gzip. You can set a regexp to enforce encoding for your big
        files before they are sent to user. The following setting will send
        all text files in compressed format to user.

            JA_SRV_XGZIP_REGEXP = "\.txt"

        When the message is composed a header is inserted into the message
        telling how the message is to be decoded, in case user doesn't have
        decent MUA that can handle the MIME type:

            X-comment: To decode, cat msg| mmencode -u| gzip -d > test.txt

        [noconv and gz]

        The `WORD1' parameter after the `FILE' is optional and user can
        override base64 encoding and request plain file if he uses word
        "noconv".

            Subject: send <FILE> [noconv|gzip]

        However, there are files where `noconv' must not be obeyed, like
        the compressed packages that you have put available in .zip, .gz,
        .tar.gz or .tgz (GNU tar) format. Following variable controls
        when file is always sent as base64:

            JA_SRV_BASE64_ALWAYS

        If the `WORD1' is "gz" or "gzip", then the gzip is explicitly
        requested, This may be desirable, because some of the text files in
        the server directory may be big and some accounts don't accept big
        messages. A typical bounce looks like:

            552 <foo@site.com>... Message is too large; 100000 bytes max
            554 <foo@site.com> Service unavailable

        These kind of file server bounce messages are handled in separate
        module which notifies the user that his account didn't accept the
        sent file.

        [case sensitivity]

        By default the request word ("send") and ITEM (filename) are not
        case sensitive, unless you set these flags:

            JA_SRV_F_CMD_CASE_SENSITIVE  = "yes"
            JA_SRV_F_FILE_CASE_SENSITIVE = "yes"

        If values are "no", then these are identical commands:

            Subject: Send Help
            Subject  SEND HELP

    Multi part mime messages

        If you want to deliver big files, you better be sure not to send
        them as a big file. That blocks the connection between every host
        along the path that the big file is transferred. The
        solution is to use MIME multi parts that can be assembled back in
        the receiving MUA. (In case you don't have multi part assembler
        receive Perl script to do it).

        MIME multiparts are sent out if

        o   Filename matches JA_SRV_BASE64_ALWAYS, typically tar.gz, zip
        o   Filesize is bigger than JA_SRV_MULTIPART_THRESHOLD, where
            default chunk size is 100K.

        When a file meets these criteria, it is read to the `BODY' of message
        and base64 encoded. This all happens in memory, so watch
        procmail logs to see if any problems with very big files. (>30Meg).
        Next, if the base64 conversion succeeded, the composed is handed
        to

            JA_SRV_MIME_MULTI_SEND

        Which does the actual delivery and splitting. The default program
        used is `splitmail'. Make sure you have it or substitute the
        program with some equivalent one.

    Stopping server

        Sometimes you're making rearrangements in you file directory or
        doing some other maintenance and you are unable to respond to `send'
        requests. You can stop the server by setting

            JA_SRV_IN_USE = "no"

        And when you want to enable the server again; just comment out the
        statement or assign `yes'. [The default is `yes']. When this
        variable is set to `no', the server sends a message from following
        variable as a response to any "send" request.

            JA_SRV_IN_USE_NO_MSG

    Using password to validate file requests

        You should be aware that this file server's implementation is public
        in nature. Anyone who asks for a file is allowed to get it. But it
        would be good if you could limit the access to documents with some
        simple way, like if you set up two file servers (see next chapter)
        where one is public and the other is interesting only to group of
        people. You can define a string that must be found in Subject field
        by setting the following variable

            JA_SRV_PASSWORD = ".*"    # default

        The default value will match anything in the subject, thus making the
        server public. But if you set it like this

            JA_SRV_PASSWORD ".*123"

        Then string "123" must be there somewhere in the line, like here

            Subject: send <FILE> 123

        Yes, "123" is actually a CMD definition, but it doesn't matter
        because there is no CMD 123. Subject now matches password and the
        server can be accessed. Of course the following is valid too.

            Subject: send <FILE> noconv 123

        If the password was wrong, server won't tell it. The message just
        lands to your mailbox in that case and you can investigate who
        tried to access the restricted server.

    Changing server's command string (multiple servers)

        The default command string is "send", but you can change it and thus
        create multiple services. Here is one example, where you have set up
        two file servers where each has its own directory.

            #   The public server

            JA_SRV_CMD_STRING           = "send"
            JA_SRV_FILE_DIR             = $HOME/server/public
            INCLUDERC                   = $HOME/procmail/pm-jasrv.rc

            #   Company server, only interests fellow workers.
            #   Here "xyz-send" is just magic server request string.
            #   Notice case sensitivity settings.

            JA_SRV_F_CMD_CASE_SENSITIVE = "yes"
            JA_SRV_CMD_STRING           = "xyz-send"
            JA_SRV_PASSWORD             = ".*12qw"
            JA_SRV_FILE_DIR             = $HOME/server/public/xyz-dir
            INCLUDERC                   = $HOME/procmail/pm-jasrv.rc

    Notes from the author

        [basic Mime type note]

        All basic files that you send must be US-ASCII, 7bit. At least that
        is the default MIME type used. See `JA_SRV_CONTENT_TYPE'. I once
        received following message back

            ----- Transcript of session follows -----
            554 <foo@bar>... Cannot send 8-bit data to 7-bit destination
            501 <foo@bar>... Data format error

        because in the previous releases, the MIME type headers were not
        in the message saying that the content really was plain 7bit ascii.

        [Sending the file as is]

        Note, that the file is included "as is" without any extra
        *start-of-file* or *end-of-file* tags. This is possible, because
        the file is sent in MIME format.

        [Using one line log entry]

        It may look very spartan to print a single line log entry. You see
        messages like above in the file server log. Using one line entry
        instead of multi line announcements makes it possible to write a small
        perl tool to parse information from a single line. If you get many
        file server messages per day, it quicker to look at the single line
        entries too.

            [ja-srv1; sh file;  Foo Bar <foo@site.com>;]
            [ja-srv1; send xxx-file.txt; Foo Bar <foo@site.com>;]
                      |
                      Server's request keywords (you may have multiple servers)

        [wish list]

        (*) MIME multipart message's mime headers may need some adjustments.

        (*) I rely on simple regexp to send out base64 or gzip files.
        The natural extension would be to use file size threshold: if file
        is bigger than N bytes, send it out with gzip. And further: if
        file is more than NN bytes, send it out as multi part MIME.

        (*) In fact there is a slight mime type errors: .zip files
        should be send as application/zip. If you have experience with the
        mime types, please contact me and help me to sort out proper
        mime headers.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to the source directory of procmail code. This
        subroutine will include many pm-jasrv-*.rc modules and other files
        from there.

        Please test the File Server in your environment before you start
        using it for every day. For example I had some weird local problem
        where PATH had /usr/contrib/bin/ where gzip was supposed to be, but
        in spite of my tries procmail didn't find it along the path. Don't
        ask why. I now use absolute binary name:

            GZIP = /usr/contrib/bin/gzip

        In addition, if your messages are not sent to recipient, but you
        get daemon message:

            ... Recipient names must be specified

        That's because you have setting SENDMAIL="sendmail"; which is not
        enough. It must be

            SENDMAIL = "sendmail -oi -t"

    Usage example

        This is my .procmailrc installation. Notice that the file server
        code is used only if you get "send" request. On the other hand, this
        double wrapping is not all necessary, you could as well rely on the
        File server's capability to detect SEND request.


            PMSRC   = $HOME/pm      # directory where the procmail rc files are
            RC_FSRV = $PMSRC/pm-jasrv.rc

            mySavedLOGFILE = $LOGFILE   # record file server actions elsewhere
            LOGFILE        = $PMSRC/pm-jasrv.log

            #   Listen "send" requests.
            :0
            *   ^Subject: +send\>
            {
                JA_SRV_FILE_DIR = $HOME/fsrv      # Where to get the files
                JA_SRV_LOG      = $HOME/fsrv.log  # Write log here
                INCLUDERC       = $RC_FSRV        # Use file server now
            }

            LOGFILE = $mySavedLOGFILE

        Send the requested file. You can dry-run test this module with
        following command: a) make sure that $HOME/test conatins any simple
        email message b) define FORMAIL if it isnot found from path.

    Note:

        The MIME headers here selected previously were:

            Content-type: application/octet-stream
            Content-transfer-encoding: x-gzip64

        But Defining own CTE such as x-gzip64 is strongly discouraged by
        the MIME RFC's. Most e-mail clients would be at a loss on how to
        handle these. Many would just bomb out and not even give you the
        opportunity to save it to a file. A more correct MIME type is this,
        which is now used:

            Content-type: application/x-gzip
            Content-transfer-encoding: base64

    Input

       o    `FILE' is the filename(chdir to directory is already done)
            `file' is _absolute_ filename
            `WORD' is next word from subject line after FILE word.
       o    JA_SRV_CMD_STRING is flag
       o    JA_SRV_F_SUBJ_NOTIFY is flag

    Output

        o   FILE_ERROR is set to "yes" if file is not found.

    Description

        This subroutine stores the message to file pointed by `MBOX'. This
        subroutine is meant to be used with the the other general purpose
        includerc files. This makes it possible to have a centralized file
        storage handling for all your rc files.

        Regular user doesn't get much out of this rc unless he mixes both
        .gz and regular files in his .procmailrc

        R e p e a t: This module is basis for general purpose procmail
        rc plug-ins to strre message to mailbox pointed by some rc
        configuration variable. Normal user can simply say in his .procmailrc:

            :0:
            mail.private

    Required settings

        (none)

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        `MBOX'          must have been set to point to message storage.
        `MBOX_SUFFIX'   is extension added to MBOX. Default is none.
        `MBOX_MH'       if "yes" then deliver to MH mailbox with
                        `MBOX_MH_CMD' which is "rcvstore" by default.

        o   message is delivered to MH mailbox using `MBOX_MH_CMD'

        otherwise

        o   If MBOX is `some.mbox'     the message is stored as is.
        o   If MBOX is `some.mbox.gz'  the message is gzipped to folder.
        o   If MBOX is `some-dir/.'    then deliver as individual files

    Example usage

            $RC_MBOX   = $PMSRC/pm-jastore.rc

            :0
            * condition
            {

    Description

        _NOTE:_ If you receive RFC 2047 encoded Subject headers like
        "Subject: =?ISO-8859-1?Q?=C4hnlichkeiten_von_=DCbungen?=", you
        must first decode it before using this subroutine. Feed the
        message to `pm-jamime-decode.rc' first.

        There are many different Email programs out there that add their
        own `reply' characters to the subject field. The most sad programs
        come usually from PC platform. Eg. Microsoft has gained a lot of
        bad reputation due to it's own standards.

        o   MS Explorer can use localized reply strings,
            Eg `Vs:' or `vast:'  seems to be Finnish `Vastaus'.
        o   MS product Outlook (??) can be configured similarly.
            I have received swedish `Sv:' `-Svar' for `Svaring' (eng: reply)
        o   MS mail uses `FW:' in forwarded mails.
        o   Intelligent MUAs try to keep count of replies with
            `Re2:' or `Re[2]'
        o   Japanese MUA Denshin 8 Go V321.1b7 has sent Re^2:
        o   Some mua uses `Re>'
        o   Lotus notes (in French version) uses `Ref:'
        o   Some MS product sends `UQ:'
        o   XXX uses `-reply'
        o   Forwarding schemes: (fwd) [fwd] <fwd> fw:  [FWD:  [FWD:]]
        o   Subject references: -subj subj- subj:

        There already is a de facto standard where message should contain
        only single `Re:' if message has been replied to (no matter how
        many times). This makes it possible to do efficient message
        threading by only using Subject and date fields. And grepping same
        subjects is lot easier than from this horrible mess. Note that
        all text is on one line, the subject has been broken only
        for visual reasons:

            Subject: re- Re^2: Re[32]: FW: Re: Re(15) Sv: Re[9]: -reply
                     (fwd) [fwd] <fwd> fw: [FWD:  [FWD:]]
                     -subj subj: subj: subj-
                     test

        This recipe standardizes any subject (like above) that has been
        replied to, to de facto format below. That is: "Any number of 'Re:'
        will be converted to *single* 'Re:' and any number of 'Fwd:' will be
        converted to *single* 'Fwd:'"

             Subject: Re: test (fwd)

    About In-Reply-To header

        If there is `In-Reply-to' header in the message, but there is
        not *Re:* in the subject line, one is added automatically.
        Some broken Mailers forget to add the *Re:* to the Subject
        line.

    Variable JA_SUBJECT_SAVE

        This is by default `yes' which causes the original subject to
        be saved under header field `X-Old-Subject'. If you don't want
        that extra header generated, set this variable to `no'

    Variable JA_SUBJECT_FWD_KILL

        This is by default `yes', which will kill extra forwarding
        indication words like (fwd) [fwd] <fwd> <f>. If you set this
        to `no', then all the forwarding words are preserved. The de
        facto forward format is:

            Subject: This subject (fwd)

    Code note

        This subroutine's intention is to make Subject more expressive
        by deleting redundant information. A simplistic approach has
        been taken where Subject consists of list of *words* whose
        each attribute can be either `ok' or `delete'. No attempt has
        been made to determine the structure of the Subject. You can
        see the algorithm better
        from an example:

            Re: New subject (was Re: Old subject)

        That should be treated syntactically like "New subject" and
        forgetting anything between parenthesis. This is however not
        respected and not even tried. The rule applied here is "One
        Re: is tolerated", so the subject won't change. It doesn't
        matter where "Re:" is.

        But here the subject is changed. The rule applied is: Delete
        all unwanted _words_ and then add one Re: to the beginning if OLD
        content had any Reply indications

                Re: New subject (was Re: Old subject)
            --> Re: New subject (was Old subject)

    IMPORTANT notice

        Please check that your `SHELL' variable setting in `~/procmailrc'
        is `sh' derivate, /bin/sh or /bin/bash. This module won't work with
        other shells.

    Awk usage note

        `awk' is a small, effective and much smaller than perl for little
        tasks. See the verbose log and make sure your awk understands
        VAR="value" passing syntax. Change it to `nawk' or `gawk' if they
        work better than your standard awk.

            AWK = "gawk"        # you may need this, try also gawk

    Customizations

        Let's say Polish M$Outlook uses `ODP:' instead of
        standard `re:' and you want to handle that too: Then set:

            JA_SUBJECT_KILL = "odp:"            # NOTE: all lowercase
            JA_SUBJECT_SAVE = "no"
            INCLUDERC       = $PMSRC/pm-jasubject.rc

        You ca use `JA_SUBJECT_KILL' to delete any additional words from the
        subject line. E.g. if you have good news-reader, you don't need the
        mailing list prefixes that some mailing lists add to the beginning

            Subject: [LIST-xxx] the subject here

        to remove that list prefix, you simply match it

            JA_SUBJECT_KILL = "(list-xxx|list-yyy)"

        Important: The regexp must be _all_ lowercase, because when match
        happens, the words have been converted to lowercase.

    Example usage

        You need nothing special, just include this recipe
        before you save message to folder.

            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jasubject.rc

    Debugging

        You can dry-run test this module with following command and watching
        output. Substitute variables as they are in your system. You feed
        the content of entire example mail where the Subject that needs
        correction is found.

            % procmail SHELL=/bin/sh AWK=gawk VERBOSE=on LOGABSTRACT=all \
              DEFAULT=/dev/null LOGFILE=$(tty) \
              JA_SUBJECT_KILL="(ace-users)" \
              PMSRC=/path/to/install/dir \
              /path/to/pm-jasubject.rc  \
              < ~/test.mail

    Thank you

        Thanks to <Tony.Lam@Eng.Sun.Com> for his creative

    Description

        This includerc parses date from variable INPUT which has string

            "hh:mm:ss"

        Example input

            "Thu, 13 Nov 1997 11:43:23 +0200"

        Returned values

            hh      = 2 digits
            mm      = 2 digits
            ss      = 2 digits

        Variable ERROR is set to "yes" if it couldn't recognize the INPUT
        and couldn't parse all hh, mm, ss variables.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include pm-javar.rc from there.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

            INPUT = string-to-parse

        The INPUT can be anything as long as it contains NN:NN:NN

    Usage example

        Get the time of received message. The From_ header will always
        have the standard time stamp.

            PMSRC           = $HOME/pm
            RC_DATE_TIME    = $PMSRC/pm-jatime.rc

            :0 c
            *  ^From +\/.*
            {
                INPUT = $MATCH
                #  Turn off the logging while executing this part

                VERBOSE=off   INCLUDERC = $RC_DATE_TIME   VERBOSE=on

                :0
                * ERROR ?? yes
                {
                   # Should not ever happen, you have broken From_
                }

Pm-jaube-keywords.rc -- Bare bones word list based UBE filter

    Warning

        Put all your UBE (aka spam) filters towards the _end_ of your
        ~/.procmailrc. The idea is that valid messages are filed
        first (mailing lists, your work and private mail, bounces) and only
        the uncategorized messages are checked.

        Now, if 50-70 % hit rate is good enough for your starting point,
        go ahead and read more. This file is supposed to be the last resort,
        if you really do not have any better tool to analyze messages.

    Overview of features

        o   Word and phrase based matching
        o   50-70 % success rate. 90 % never achieved. That's a guarantee.
        o   Extremely fast and a dream to CPU resources. Implemented in pure
            procmail and you can almost hear the humming sound of its
            regular expression engine shredding UBE messages to pieces.

    Description

        Are you sure you want use this word list based checking?

        Think twice before you use this subroutine. It knows nothing about
        the content your mail. "It's all UBE unless proven otherwise" is the
        motto. The brutal search tracks words and phrases to find an indication
        of mass posting and traces of Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE aka spam).
        _Repeat:_ Read the first paragraph again before you consider putting
        this file into action. This filter WILL PASS through unwanted mail
        and it WILL catch good mail. This is rule based matching, so I suppose
        you know where you're putting your head with this. Ahem. Alerted? Good.

       The Story

        There was a man and mail account. The account had limited space,
        couldn't install any other programs because disk quota would have
        exceeded. System administrators weren't' interested in installing
        anything. The Mail server ran behind firewall and had OS that was
        never heard of - it couldn't run other programs. Or if it could,
        the Bad system administrator was too scared to install extra
        programs to the host MTA ran. No joy -- no means to stop incoming
        UBE -- Right?

        Wrong. There was procmail. The Bad system adminitrator didn't mention
        that `~/.procmailrc' was honored - just the the external programs
        we a no-no-no (Technical: the MDA host mounted user disks; the
        server ran on separate host and couldn't use any of the user
        compiled programs. Statically linked ones filled up the man's disk
        space).

        First line of defense, any defense would do. So, this rule based
        file was born. Nothing else was installed in that account and the
        happy word list based matching routine kept chewing mail, mail,
        mail. And the system administrator was happy - he nurtured the MTA
        host's CPU resources and noticed nothing alarming. All ticked like
        clockwork.

        Life began again. After 1000 mail bombards a day, the account was
        usable again.

       Motivation

        If you can, use the Bayesian filters and forget all rule based
        ones, word and phrase matching based ones; all static filters. On
        the other hand, if you want quick solution, even imperfect, until
        you have time to learn and setup other tools, this subroutine may
        be of interest.

        The best part. You can carry this single file anywhere where procmail
        lives. No other files are needed. Setup couldn't be simpler.

    About bouncing message back

        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE
        sender is not there, because the address is usually forged. Do not
        increase the network traffic. Instead save the messages to folders
        and periodically check their contents. It's not nice to be forced to
        apologize about bounces to a wrong destination.

    Code Note

        Procmail is picky about the whitespace in continuing lines, make sure
        there is _not_ a single spaces left after the continuation backslash.
        Use good editors or external programs to get rid of the white spaces. In
        Emacs you would add this line to your `~/.emacs' startup file:
        "(add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'delete-trailing-whitespace)"

            :0
            * ^Subject:.*(regexp\
                    |and-more\
                    |and-more\
                    )
            {
                # Process it
            }

        Why are the regexps put into this file and not to a separate regexp
        file? Good question. It is possible to check message's content with
        external process, like `grep', to see if any matches are found.
        This kind of methodology is covered in Procmail Tips section
        "Using grep with file lists to mach messages" at
        <http://pm-tips.sf.net>. The reason why all the regexp are maintained
        inside this file is:

        o   Simplicity. One file - no extra configuration files or regexp
            databases.
        o   Self standing. Does not call external processes, so it's a little
            faster than possible `grep' and `fgrep' solution.

    Required settings

        None. No dependencies to other procmail modules.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   JA_UBE_KEYWORD_HEADER, if set, then the results are put to
            messages headers. By default this variable is not defined
            to save from external `formail' process call.
            Suggestion: "X-Spam-JaubeKwd"; without trailing colon.

    Return values

        o   `ERROR_STATUS' is set to word "Bad" otherwise empty.
        o   `ERROR' is set to short descriptive word that indicate which
            rule was matched. Values: *Header-FromKeywords*,
            *Header-SubjectKeywords* and *Body-Keywords*
        o   `ERROR_MATCH' is set to some words that happened to trigger
            UBE catch rule.

    Usage example

            PMSRC     = "/path/to/procmail/lib"
            #   Exclude these addresses from tests
            VALID_FROM = "(my@address.example.com|word@here.example.com)"

            :0
            *$ ! ^From:.*$VALID_FROM
            *  !  FROM_DAEMON
            {
                INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jaube-keywords.rc

                #  Variable "ERROR" is set if message was UBE

                :0 :
                * ! ERROR ?? ^^^^

    Description

        There are several Bayesian based statistical analysis programs that
        study the message's tokens and then classify it into two categories:
        good or bad, or if you like, ham and spam. All the Bayesian programs
        are not the same, so if you want to achive magic 99.99% probability
        the only methodology to do that is to chain several programs in
        serially. There is no single program that can solve the UBE detection.
        This procmail subroutine implements call interface to program
        `annoyance-filter', which must already have been installed.

    About bouncing message back

        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE
        sender is not there, because the address forged. Do not increase
        the network traffic; you will not do any good to anybody by
        bouncing messgas -- you just increase mail traffic even more.
        Instead save the messages to folders and periodically periodically
        check their contents.

    Required settings

        If `annoyance-filter' program is available, define this variable in your
        `~/.procmailrc'. Use absolute path to make the external shell
        quick; it'll save server load considerably.

            JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_PRG = /usr/bin/spamprobe

        If you _do_ _not_ have program installed, do not leave the
        variable lying aroung, because it will keep this subroutine active.
        Calling a non existing program is not a good idea, so it better to
        empty the variable if the program is not available.

    Required settings

        None. No dependencies to other procmail modules.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   `JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_PRG', path to the program [required].
        o   `JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_SPAM_DB', path to the dictionary database
            [required]. E.g. `$HOME/.annoyance/dict.db'.
        o   `JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_SPAM_DB_OPT', type of dictionary to read.
            Default is "--read", but this could be fast dictionary option
            "--fread".
        o   `JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_HEADER', the header name where the results
            are put. If not defined, no header is added.
            Defaults to *X-Spam-Annoyance-Status*
        o   `JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_FORCE', if set to _yes_ then call program no matter
            what. Normally if there already is *X-Spam-Annoyance-Status* header,
            it is assumed that the message has already been checked
            and no new checking is needed.

    Return values

        o   ERROR, is set to the return value of the program.

    Usage example

            PMSRC                = $HOME/procmail # procmail recipe dir

            <other checks, mailing lists, work mail etc.>

            JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_PRG     = "/usr/bin/nice -n 5 /usr/bin/annoyance-filter"
            JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_SPAM_DB = $HOME/.annoyance/dict.db
            INCLUDERC                = $PMSRC/pm-jaube-prg-spamprobe.rc

            #   The ERROR will contains word "yes" if message was spam

            * ERROR ?? yes

        o   SpamAssassin                (perl matching + bayesian)
        o   SpamProbe                   (bayesian)
        o   SPASTIC                     (procmail recipes)

        This subroutine implements call interface to `bmf' program. Why
        whould you need it? Because unfortunately `bmf' by default
        use exactly the same headers as spamasassin and the two cannot
        co-operate together: bmf would overwrite existing
        spamassasin headers. This subroutine takes care of saving
        previous headers and move `bmf' results to their own
        `X-Spam-bmf-*' headers.

    About bouncing message back

        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces.
        The UBE sender is not there, because the address forged. Do
        not increase the network traffic; you will not do any good to
        anybody by bouncing messgas -- you just increase mail traffic
        even more. Instead save the messages to folders and
        periodically periodically check their contents.

    Required settings

        If `bmf' program is available, define this variable in your
        `~/.procmailrc'. Use absolute path to make the external shell
        quick; it'll save server load considerably.

            JA_UBE_BMF_PRG = "/usr/bin/bmf"

        If you _do_ _not_ have program installed, do not leave the
        variable lying aroung, because it will keep this subroutine active.
        Calling a non existing program is not a good idea, so it better to
        empty the variable if the program is not available.

    Required settings

        None. No dependencies to other procmail modules.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   JA_UBE_BMF_PRG, path to program
        o   JA_UBE_BMF_HEADER_PREFIX, the header name where the results
            are put. If not defined, no headers are added. Default
            value is `X-Spam-bmf'.
        o   JA_UBE_BMF_FORCE, if set to _yes_ then call program no matter
            what. Normally if there already are `X-Spam-bmf-*' headers,
            it is assumed that the message has already been checked
            and no new checking is needed.

    Return values

        o   ERROR, is set to short ube trigger recipe reason. Contains
            content of `X-Spam-bmf-Status' header which you can check
            for values
        o   ERROR_MATCH contains detailed content of
            `X-Spam-bmf-Status' header.

        If headers were enabled, they will contain:

            X-Spam-bmf-Status: Yes, hits=1.000000 required=0.900000, tests=bmf
            X-Spam-bmf-Flag: YES

    Usage example

            PMSRC            = $HOME/procmail # procmail recipe dir

            <other checks, mailing lists, work mail etc.>

            JA_UBE_BMF_PRG   = "/usr/bin/nice -n 5 /usr/bin/bmf"

            #   The ERROR will contains word "yes" if it program classified
            #   the message into "bad" category.

        end of your `~/.procmailrc'. The idea is that valid messages are filed
        first (mailing lists, your work and private mail, bounces) and only
        the uncategorized messages are checked last.

        YOU CANNOT USE THIS PROCMAIL SUBROUTINE UNLESS YOU HAVE TRAINED THE
        BAYESIAN PROGRAM FIRST!

        To train:

    Overview of features

        o   Implements interface to http://www.sf.net/projects/bogofilter

    Description

        There are several Bayesian based statistical analysis programs that
        study the message's tokens and then classify it into two categories:
        good or bad, or if you like, ham and spam. All the Bayesian programs
        are not the same, so if you want to achive magic 99.99% probability
        the only methodology to do that is to chain several programs in
        serially. There is no single program that can solve the UBE detection.
        This procmail subroutine implements call interface to program
        `bogofilter', which must already have been installed.

    About bouncing message back

        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE

        o   JA_UBE_BOGOFILTER_HEADER_NEW, the header name where the results
            are put. If not defined, no header is added.

        o   JA_UBE_BOGOFILTER_FORCE, if set to _yes_ then call program no matter
            what. Normally if there already is `X-Spam-*' header,
            it is assumed that the message has already been checked
            and no new checking is needed.

    Return values

        o   ERROR, is set to the return value of program if message was spam.

    Overview of features

        o   To detect spam reliably, run all Bayesian programs one by one
            to see if any of them classifies the message as spam.
        o   Programs supported: bogofilter, spamprobe, Bayesian Mail
            Filter, Annoyance Filter, Bsfilter, Spamoracle and Spamassassin.

    Description

        There are several bayesian based statistical analysis programs that
        study the message's tokens and then classify it into two categories:
        good or bad, or if you like, ham and spam. This module is a
        _meta_ _package_ which will call all other individual modules
        that interface to these Bayesian programs. The use is simple: define
        programs that are available in your system and which you have
        trained (Bayesian programs need to be trained before use), and this
        this module will query how those programs would classify the message.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-jaube-prg-spamprobe.rc
        o   pm-jaube-prg-spamoracle.rc
        o   pm-jaube-prg-annoyance-filter.rc
        o   pm-jaube-prg-bsfilter.rc
        o   pm-jaube-prg-bmf.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        To activate Bayesian program(s), define path to them. Default
        value for all these variables is "" i.e. is is supposed that
        no programs have been installed or trained.

        o   `JA_UBE_BOGOFILTER_PRG', path to *bogofilter* program.
        o   `JA_UBE_SPAMPROBE_PRG', Path to *spamprobe* program
        o   `JA_UBE_BMF_PRG', Path to Bayesian Mail Filter *bmf* program.
        o   `JA_UBE_SPAMASSASSIN_PRG', path to *spamassassin* program.
            If daemon version is available, set this to *spamc* program.
        o   `JA_UBE_SPAMORACLE_PRG', path to *spamoracle* program.
        o   `JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_PRG', path to *annoyance-filter* program.
            You must also set `JA_UBE_ANNOYANCE_SPAM_DB' to fast
            dictionary database location.
        o   `JA_UBE_BSFILTER_PRG', path to *bsfilter* program.

        Optional variables to set:

        o    `JA_UBE_BOGOFILTER_OPT'. Default is "-p" passthrough.
             Option "-e" will report exit code to procmail.
        o    `JA_UBE_SPAMASSASSIN_OPT'. Default is "".
        o    `JA_UBE_SPAMASSASSIN_MAX_SIZE'. Default is 256000 (256k).
             Spamassassin is a Perl program, which is slow at startup,
             so checking e.g. long attachements consumes lot of resources.
             Keep this value relatively small.

    Important notes

        All headers are canonicalized to *X-Spam-<PROGRAM>-* so e.g.
        in bogofilter's case, the default *X-Bogocity* header is
        changed to value *X-Spam-Bogofilter-Status* and so on.
        Summaries like below can then be generated:

            $ egrep -i '(Subject|From|^X-Spam.*Status)' *.mbox

    Return values

        o   `ERROR' variable's first word is set to program that classified
            the spam: *bogofilter*, *bmf* (Bayesian Mail Filter),
            *spamassassin* etc. It is followed by semicolon ";" and
            detailed return status from the program.
        o   `ERROR_INFO' is set only in bogofilter's case if it thinks
            the message is neither spam nor ham ("Unsure").

    Usage example

            PMSRC                 = $HOME/procmail # procmail recipe dir

            # ... other checks, mailing lists, work mail etc.

            #   bogofilter and Bayesian Mail Filter available and trained. Use them.

            JA_UBE_BOGOFILTER_PRG = "/bin/nice -n 5 /bin/bogofilter"
            JA_UBE_BMF_PRG        = "/bin/nice -n 5 /bin/bmf"

            #   Call the "umbrella" module, which will take care of
            #   all the details.

            INCLUDERC             = $PMSRC/pm-jaube-prg-runall.rc

    Warning

        Put all your Unsolicited Bulk Emacil (aka spam) filters towards the
        end of your `~/.procmailrc'. The idea is that valid messages are filed
        first (mailing lists, your work and private mail, bounces) and only
        the uncategorized messages are checked last.

        YOU CANNOT USE THIS PROCMAIL SUBROUTINE UNLESS YOU HAVE TRAINED THE
        BAYESIAN PROGRAM FIRST!

        To train:

            $ rm -f ~/.spamassassin/bayes*
            $ sa-learn $opt --local --no-rebuild --ham  good.msg ...
            $ sa-learn $opt --local --no-rebuild --spam spam.msg ...
            $ sa-learn --rebuild

    Overview of features

        o   Implements interface to http://www.spamassassin.org/
            project.
        o   variable `ERROR' is set if message was spam.
        o   Results are available in default headers (X-Spam-*)

    Description

        There are several Bayesian based statistical analysis programs that
        study the message's tokens and then classify it into two categories:
        good or bad, or if you like, ham and spam. All the Bayesian programs
        are not the same, so if you want to achive magic 99.99% probability
        the only methodology to do that is to chain several programs in
        serially. There is no single program that can solve the UBE detection.
        This procmail subroutine implements call interface to program
        `spamassassin', which must already have been installed.

    About bouncing message back

        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE
        sender is not there, because the address forged. Do not increase
        the network traffic; you will not do any good to anybody by
        bouncing messgas -- you just increase mail traffic even more.
        Instead save the messages to folders and periodically periodically
        check their contents.

    Required settings

        If `spamassassin' program is available, define this variable in your
        `~/.procmailrc'. Use absolute path to make the external shell
        quick; it'll save server load considerably.

            JA_UBE_SPAMASSASSIN_PRG = /usr/bin/spamassassin

        If you _do_ _not_ have program installed, do not leave the
        variable lying aroung, because it will keep this subroutine active.
        Calling a non existing program is not a good idea, so it better to
        empty the variable if the program is not available.

    Required settings

        None. No dependencies to other procmail modules.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   JA_UBE_SPAMASSASSIN_PRG, path to the program
        o   JA_UBE_SPAMASSASSIN_MIN_SIZE, minumum message size. Default is
            100 bytes.
        o   JA_UBE_SPAMASSASSIN_MAX_SIZE, maximum message size. Default is
            256 000 bytes (about 256k).
        o   JA_UBE_SPAMASSASSIN_FORCE, if set to _yes_ then call program no
            matter what. Normally if there already is `X-Spam-*' header,
            it is assumed that the message has already been checked
            and no new checking is needed.

    Return values

        o   ERROR, is set to the return value of program if message was spam.
        o   ERROR_INFO, is set if case is "unsure".

    Usage example

            PMSRC                   = $HOME/procmail # procmail recipe dir

            <other checks, mailing lists, work mail etc.>

            INCLUDERC               = $PMSRC/pm-jaube-prg-spamassassin.rc

            #   The ERROR will contains reason if program classified
            #   the message into "bad" category.

    Overview of features

        o   Implements interface to http://freecode.com/projects/spamoracle
            OCaml language based Bayesian Mail program.
        o   Variable `ERROR' is set to "yes" if the message was UBE.
        o   Results are available in headers `X-Spam-Spamoracle-Status',
            `X-Spam-Spamoracle-Score', `X-Spam-Spamoracle-Details' and
            `X-Spam-Spamoracle-Attachment'  for further analysis.

    Description

        There are several bayesian based statistical analysis programs that
        study the message's tokens and then classify it into two categories:
        good or bad, or if you like, ham and spam. All the Bayesian programs
        are not the same, so if you want to achive magic 99.99% probability
        the only methodology to do that is to chain several programs in
        serially. There is no single program that can solve the UBE detection.

        Using Spamoracle as sole spam protection is inefficient, because
        version version 1.4 (2004-09-29) does not accept messages from
        stdin. Becaus of this message has to be written to a temporary file
        before calling Spamoracle. Later the temporary file must be removed
        with `rm'. All these three shell calls are needed for each message.
        If you have other detection programs, call them first to identify
        unsolicited Bulk Email.

    About bouncing message back

        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE
        sender is not there, because the address forged. Do not increase
        the network traffic; you will not do any good to anybody by
        bouncing messgas -- you just increase mail traffic even more.
        Instead save the messages to folders and periodically periodically
        check their contents.

        If `spamoracle' program is available, define this variable in your
        `~/.procmailrc'. Use absolute path to make the external shell
        quick; it'll save server load considerably.

            JA_UBE_SPAMORACLE_PRG = /usr/bin/spamoracle

        If you _do_ _not_ have program installed, do not leave the
        variable lying aroung, because it will keep this subroutine active.
        Calling a non existing program is not a good idea, so it better to
        empty the variable if the program is not available.

    Required settings

        None. No dependencies to other procmail modules.

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   `JA_UBE_SPAMORACLE_PRG', path to program
        o   `JA_UBE_SPAMORACLE_HEADER_PREFIX', the header name where the results
            are put. If not defined, no headers are added. Default
            value is  *X-Spam-Spamoracle'*.
        o   `JA_UBE_SPAMORACLE_FORCE', if set to _yes_ then call program no matter
            what. Normally if there already are *X-Spam-Spamoracle-* headers,
            it is assumed that the message has already been checked
            and no new checking is needed.
        o   `JA_UBE_SPAMORACLE_REGEXP', regexp to match for spam probability.
            Defaul value will match probabbility of 0.8 with 5 interesting words.
            The match is tried agains *X-Spam-Spamoracle-Score* header.

    Return values

        o   `ERROR', value  "yes" if `JA_UBE_SPAMORACLE_REGEXP' matched.
        o   `ERROR_MATCH' contains detailed content of
            `X-Spam-Spamoracle-Score' header.

        If headers were enabled, they will contain these values. The
        score's values are spam probability 0.0 - 1.0 and the degree of
        similarity 0-15 of the message with the spam messages in the
        corpus.

    Warning

        Put all your UBE (aka spam) filters towards the _end_ of your
        ~/.procmailrc. The idea is that valid messages are filed
        first (mailing lists, your work and private mail, bounces) and only
        the uncategorized messages are checked.

    Are you sure you want to use procmail for UBE?

        If you think you can put this recipe as a first line of defence to
        your mail, you will disappoint. Checking UBE with procmail's
        rule based means does not work that way. The good messages
        must be sorted first (like your mailing lists and your
        important work or friend message) and only then what's left to
        process can be scanned by static rule based tools, like this
        procmail module. There are much more better tools that are
        based on statistical analysis of messages. You really should
        consider using one or combination of Bayesian tools:
        *Spamassassin*, *bogofilter*, *spamprobe*, *Bayesian* *Mail*
        *Filter*, *ifile* etc.

        _Repeat:_ procmail rules are not the tool to UBE control. The
        pattern matching rules can never keep up with the spammers. That
        said, if you:

        o   Can bare a 70-80 % UBE detection rate.
        o   Can bare 10 % false hits; you need to check you UBE folder
            regularly for messaged that did not belong there.
        o   Have an account that does not get large number of UBE messages.
        o   Or if procmail is all you have in the system.

        only then consider this module or any other procmail based
        spam filters in that respect. So, please don't set your
        expectations high. Spend good time with the configuration
        variables and check there returned result in variable `ERROR'
        carefully. Good luck.

    Overview of features

        o   Requires procmail 3.11pre7+
        o   You don't need external files: site block lists, the
            heuristics nail most of the UBE messages. Just plug in this
            module and you have UBE shield active.
        o   Header based filtering: Minimum headers, Pegasus bulk mail,
            X-uidl validity check, bogus From-To combination,
        o   Address based filtering: Numeric address, Invalid address (eg.
            me@myMarketing.global), UBE-like(friend,remove request.)
        o   Text filtering: no html accepted, common advertising slogans,
            unnecessary many capitalized words, HTML message body detection,
        o   And many more check that just not were listed here.

        Remember: this is not 100% and there will always be some mishits, so
        don't just junk messages to `/dev/null'.

    Description

        Originally Daniel Smith posted his spam.rc, where he had gathered
        many tips and heuristics to filter UBE email. This filter here
        expresses work of many procmail users.  Original filters were
        modified, some rules were left out that catched false email
        messages and made the package look a bit more general so that it
        could be included via `INCLUDERC' in the standard way.

        Thanks to Daniel and others, the UBE bomb days can be reduced,
        when this filter is active. Some UBE messages may still lurk
        into the mailbox, but that's the problem with all static rule
        based tools.

    Logging the events

        A good strategy to follow incoming mail is to log the vital parts

                [my; emacs;   Re: Gnus (Emacs Newsreader) FAQ ]

        First a UBE message that was identified and saved
        to folder. Next 3 messages were filed to mailing-list folders and
        there was no [] action displayed for them (left out due to high
        volume of these messages). Second Last was internal work
        message. Lastly someone asked somthign about Emacs.

        The basic incoming message log recipe could be like this.
        Variable `TODAY' is `$YYYY-$MM-$DD' whose values are set after
        calling `pm-jadate.rc'. The `LISTS' is user set variable to exclude
        mailing lists whose activity is not important. Variables `FROM' and
        `SUBJECT' are fields read the message's headers.

            BIFF      = $HOME/Mail/mail.log
            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jadate.rc
            ...

            :0 hwic:
            *$ ! $LISTS
            |echo "$TODAY $FROM $FSUBJECT" >> $BIFF

        Here is small perl script to print summary of trapped UBE
        messages from a log like above. It gives nice overview which recipes
        catch most of the UBE messages.

            perl -ne '/jaube; (\S+)/; $s{$1}++;                         \
                 END {  $s = (map{$x += $_; $_= $x} values %s)[-1];     \
                        $i = int $s{$_}/$s *100;                        \
                        for (keys %s) { printf "$s{$_} $i $_\n" }       \
                     }'                                                 \
                 mail.log |                                             \
                 sort -nr

        Here is sample results during two month period There are total of
        3248 UBE messages catched.

    About bouncing message back

        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE
        sender is not there, because the address is usually forged. Do not
        increase the network traffic. Instead save the messages to folders
        and periodically check their contents. It's not nice to be forced to
        apologize if you bounced message to a wrong destination. DON'T
        BOUNCE. Forget all recipe examples that use HOST and EXITCODE and
        be a good Net citizen.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This
        recipe file will include

        o   pm-javar.rc
        o   pm-janslookup.rc
        o   pm-jaaddr.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        Only handful of the most important variables are described here.
        You really should read all the comments placed in the "user configured
        section" in this procmail module's code. Most of the defaults
        should work out of the box.

        o   `JA_UBE_VALID_ADDR', your email addresses or other
            valid from addresses that will say "this is mail addressed
            directly to you".
        o   `JA_UBE_HDR', If non-empty, a new header is added which tells which
            recipe was triggered. The header is not added to message, if
            there is nothing to report; i.e. message passed all tests.
        o   Various flags: Some of the ube detecting recipes give more
            false hits than nail real ube. Experiment with yourself and turn
            on or off the recipes that work for the kind of ube messages
            you receive.
        o   `JA_UBE_MAX_BIG_WORDS', the maximum count of big letter words in the
            message that is tolerated. The current count 5 is rather
            conservative and it is suggested you to increase it to prevent
            trapping too many false hits. Alternatively update JA_UBE_CAPS_OK
            to include accepted words.
        o   `JA_UBE_APPARENTLY_TO_MAX', how many Apparently-To headers are
            tolerated. Default is 3.
        o   `JA_UBE_MAX_HTML_TAGS', maximum count of html tags allowed in the
            body.
        o   `JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_ILLEGAL_KILL', if set to "yes" (default), then
            illegal attachment from body is ripped off. This is brute way
            to truncate the message abruptly to save mailbox space. You still
            see the headers for tracking, but the body is gone. The regexp
            to test is set in `JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_ILLEGAL_REGEXP'.
        o   `JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_SUSPECT_KILL', if set to "yes" (default "no"),
            kill suspectible characters in attachement filename. The regexp
            to test is set in `JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_SUSPECT_NAME_REGEXP'.
        o   JA_UBE_CHARSET_LEGAL, if set, accept only these character. The
            default value detect messages with 7bit only (english speaking.
            For foreign language you may want to set this something like
            `$CHAR_7BIT_SET$CHAR_LIST_FINLAD'
            for Finnish. See `pm-javar.rc' for available character sets.

    Return values

        o   `ERROR_STATUS', status word of checks. Value "Good" or "Bad"
        o   `ERROR,' is set to short ube trigger recipe reason
        o   `ERROR_MATCH', is set to some MATCH that happened while triggering
            UBE message.

        Alternatively you check content of header `JA_UBE_HDR' which contains
        results of the above variables. Possible values for `ERROR' are:

            AddrAOLinvalid
            AddrBogus-From
            AddrInvalid-From
            AddrInvalid-To
            AddrNumeric
            AddrNumericDomain
            AddrUbeLike
            BodyAttachment-FileIllegalAdditional
            BodyAttachment-FileIllegalMatch
            BodyAttachment-FileIllegalOther
            BodyAttachment-FileSuspect
            BodyCharacters-Illegal

            NotEnoughHeaders
            Received-IPError
            VirusBody
            VirusHeader

    Usage example

            # - All legimate messages should already been handled and
                saved before this recipe.
            # - Activate the filter only for messages that are not from
            #   daemon and not from valid senders: like from "my" domain
            #   and mailing lists and from somewhere else.

            VALID_FROM = "(my@address.example.com|word@here.example.com)"

            :0
            *$ ! ^From:.*$VALID_FROM
            *$ ! FROM_DAEMON
            {

                #   Do not add extra headers. This saves external shell call
                #   (formail). Also do not try to kill the message content,
                #   again saving one external call (awk). With these, the
                #   recipe is faster and more CPU friendly.

                PM_JA_UBE_HDR                  = ""
                JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_ILLEGAL_KILL = "no"

                INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jaube.rc

                #   Variable "ERROR" is set if message was UBE, record error
                #   to log file with "()\/"

                :0 :
                * ERROR ?? ()\/[a-z].*
                {
                    #  Don't save those *.exe, *.zip UBE attachements
                    :0
                    *  ERROR ?? attacment.*file
                    /dev/null

                    :0 :
                    spam.mbox
                }
            }

        There may be UBE messages that fool `FROM_DAEMON' test, so
        you could also use something more finer check. The standard daemon
        error message almost always has sentence "Transcript of session
        follows" in the body. This recipe says: "Unless proven otherwise,
        I don't believe this is daemon message even if it looked like that".
        Add More "2^1" checks to raise score for other valid daemon cases.

            *   -1^0       ^FROM_DAEMON
            * !  2^1  B ?? Transcript of session follows
            {
                # ... Now call UBE checker
            }

    Description

        Framework for all programs that need to reply to messages only once.
        Usually known as "vacation" feature. If you cahnge th cache file,
        you can attach this recipe to any messages that you want to deal with
        only once.

    Required settings

        PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
        will include

        o   pm-javar.rc

    Call arguments (variables to set before calling)

        o   JA_VAC, To activate vacation, set value to "yes"
        o   JA_VAC_RC, When new message-id is found, run this includerc
        o   JA_VAC_ID_CACHE, Remember to clear this file when you start
            the vacation.

    Usage example

        To turn on the vacation feature, create ~/.vac file and recipe below
        activates vacation. If the vacation is not active, then cache file
        is removed. (automatic cleanup). The VERBOSE is also turned off
        when you're on vacation; so that your procmail log will not get
        filled.

        So when you go to vacation, you 'touch ~/.vac' and update
        ~/vacation.msg. When you come back, you 'rm ~/.vac'. That's it.

        IMPORTANT: If you are subscribed to mailing lists, be sure to file
        messages from those services first and put the vacation recipe
        only after the list or bot messages. Also add sufficent "!" conditions
        in order not to reply to other "bot" service messages.

            JA_VAC_ID_CACHE = $HOME/.pm-vac.cache

            :0
            *$ ? $IS_EXIST $HOME/.vac
            {
                VERBOSE     = off
                JA_VAC      = "yes"
                JA_VAC_RC   = $PMSRC/pm-myvac.rc        # my vacation recipe
                INCLUDERC   = $PMSRC/pm-javac.rc        # framework
            }
            :0 E                                        # else
            * ? $IS_EXIST $JA_VAC_ID_CACHE
            {
                dummy = `$RM -f $JA_VAC_ID_CACHE`
            }

        Here is example of pm-myvac.rc recipe

            #  Change subject

            :0 fhw
            * ^Subject: *\/[^ ].*
            | $FORMAIL -I "Subject: vacation (was: $MATCH)"

            :0 fb           # put message to body
            | $CAT $HOME/.vacation.msg

    Description

        This file defines common variables that you can use in the recipe's
        condition line. Procmail does not know about escape sequences
        like `\t' or `\n' and it is therefore much more readable to use
        variables as substitute for common regular expression
        atoms. Pay attention that the line starts with "*$ ", where
        "$" expands the variables: In this file, the variable names
        represent the well known Perl regular expression names, so
        that $s is alost like Perl expression \s (whitespace) and $S
        is almost equivalent to `\S' (non-whitespace). Similarly, $d is
        `\d' (digit) and $D resembled `\D' (non-digit).

            :0
            *$ $s+something+$s+$d+$a+

        The equivalent without variables (you don't see the tabs and
        spaces here):

            :0
            #  Space + tab
            * [         ]something[     ][0-9]+[a-z]+


        In addition all system dependent variables are defined in this module.
        For example if you have Gnu awk, it is strongly suggest that you set:

            AWK = "/path/to/gawk"  # in Linux, this would be /usr/bin/awk

        You can define these variables before or after the module, just make
        sure the binaries reflect your operating system's paths. In general,
        if you "port" your setup to several system, dont' include absolute
        paths. In the other hand, if your setup is in the same place using
        absolute paths will speed up executions by a factor of 3 or more.
        (depending on how long your PATH is)

    Standard variables defined

        See pm-tips.txt file for full explanation or look at the source code.

            SPC WSPC NSPC SPCL       # Whitespace, Non Whitespace, W+linefeed
            \s \d \D \w \W and \a \A # perl equivalents

    Special variable JA_FROM_DAEMON

        In order to boost procmail and to save extra CPU cycles, this module
        defines variable `JA_FROM_DAEMON' that caches the information of
        ^FROM_DAEMON. You can refer to `JA_FROM_DAEMON' as you would to
        big brother FROM_DAEMON. This has the advantage that procmail
        has already computed the result and the variable `JA_FROM_DAEMON'
        is used as a cache, thus avoiding repeated FROM_DAEMON regexp
        tests, which are expensive. Variable `JA_FROM_DAEMON_match'
        contains "" or the result of matched daemon text.

            *$ $JA_FROM_DAEMON

        or the familiar

            *$ ! $JA_FROM_DAEMON

        Instead of using the regexp parsing with

            * ^FROM_DAEMON

        and

            * ! ^FROM_DAEMON

    Special variable JA_FROM_MAILER

        Works like `JA_FROM_DAEMON' variable but in respect to FROM_MAILER.
        The matches text is in `JA_FROM_MAILER_MATCH'

    Usage example

        For your .procmailrc, you can simply put this, because you
        want to load the variables at startup

            PMSRC     = "/path/to/install/location/of/this/library"
            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-javar.rc

        If you're developing your own modules that use these variables
        put these lines at the beginning. `~/.procmailrc'. It checks
        if WSPC variable does not include a space --> load the
        variable definitions. If the variable is already defined, the
        file is not loaded. The test line is something alike #ifdef --
        #endif in C/C++ language or a conditional "import" command in
        other languages.

            :0
            * ! WSPC ?? [ ]
            {
                INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-javar.rc
            }

    Defined modules

        After this file loads, you can refer to any module with $RC_JA_MODULE.
        E.g. to call email spit module in your code you would use following.
        See at the end of this file for all defined module names.

            INCLUDERC = $RC_JA_UBE
