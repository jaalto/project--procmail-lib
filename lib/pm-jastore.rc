#   Description
#
#	This subroutine stores the message to file pointed by `MBOX'. This
#	subroutine is meant to be used with the the other general purpose
#	includerc files. This makes it possible to have a centralized file
#	storage handling for all your rc files.
#
#	Regular user doesn't get much out of this rc unless he mixes both
#	.gz and regular files in his .procmailrc
#
#	R e p e a t: This module is basis for general purpose procmail
#	rc plug-ins to strre message to mailbox pointed by some rc
#	configuration variable. Normal user can simply say in his .procmailrc:
#
#	    :0:
#	    mail.private
#
#   Required settings
#
#	(none)
#
#   Call arguments (variables to set before calling)
#
#	`MBOX'		must have been set to point to message storage.
#	`MBOX_SUFFIX'	is extension added to MBOX. Default is none.
#	`MBOX_MH'	if "yes" then deliver to MH mailbox with
#			`MBOX_MH_CMD' which is "rcvstore" by default.
#
#	o   message is delivered to MH mailbox using `MBOX_MH_CMD'
#
#       otherwise
#
#	o   If MBOX is `some.mbox'     the message is stored as is.
#	o   If MBOX is `some.mbox.gz'  the message is gzipped to folder.
#	o   If MBOX is `some-dir/.'    then deliver as individual files
#
#   Example usage

#           :0
