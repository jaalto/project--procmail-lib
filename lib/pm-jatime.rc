#
#   Description
#
#	This includerc parses date from variable INPUT which has string
#
#           "hh:mm:ss"
#
#       Example input
#
#           "Thu, 13 Nov 1997 11:43:23 +0200"
#
#       Returned values
#
#           hh      = 2 digits
#           mm	    = 2 digits
#           ss      = 2 digits
#
#	Variable ERROR is set to "yes" if it couldn't recognize the INPUT
#	and couldn't parse all hh, mm, ss variables.
#
#   Required settings
#
#	PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
#       will include pm-javar.rc from there.
#
#   Call arguments (variables to set before calling)
#
#           INPUT = string-to-parse
#
#       The INPUT can be anything as long as it contains NN:NN:NN
#
#   Usage example
#
#	Get the time of received message. The From_ header will always
#	have the standard time stamp.
