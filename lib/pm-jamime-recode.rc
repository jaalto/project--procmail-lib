#   Documentation
#
#       This subroutine supposes that message has been handled by
#       'pm-jamime-decode.rc'. The purpose is to restore *Subject* and
#       *From* headers back to quoted printable format so that
#       messages can be savely saved through IMAP system which may not
#       handle 8-bit messages. If message is stored directly to
#       mailbox and the used Mail user Agent has no problems with
#       dealing 8-bit characters, this module is not needed.
#
#	An example where this subroutine could be applied:
#
#	o   Feed message to `pm-jamime-decode.rc'
#	o   Feed message `pm-jasubject.rc' (to clean multiple Re: Re: Fwd ..)
#	o   Restore From/Subject encodings with `pm-jamime-recode.rc'
#	o   Save message to mailbox
#
#   Notes
#
#       Perl or python is not used, because both are CPU intensive.
#       It would be too expansive for accounts or environments
#       receiving hundreds of mails per day (like from several mailing
#       lists).
#
#   Required settings
#
#       Variable `PMSRC' must point to source directory of procmail code.
#       This subroutine will include
#
#       o   pm-javar.rc
#       o   pm-jamime.rc
#       o   Program `$MIME_BIN_QP_E'
#           must have been installed (see pm-javar.rc).
#	o   pm-jamine-decode.rc must have been called and message must
#	    contain headers `X-Mime-Header-Decoded-*'
#
#   Call arguments (variables to set before calling)
#
#       o   `JA_MIME_RECODE_TREAT_SUBJECT', default "yes". Decode
#           Subject header by removing mime.
#       o   `JA_MIME_RECODE_TREAT_FROM', default "no". Decode
#           From header by removing mime.
#
#   Return values
#
#       (none)
#
#   Examples
#
#       To fix Subject header and then make it 7bit clean again. Note,
#       this may not be exactly what you want. The pm-jamime-decode.rc
#       file does a little more than  From/Header handling (also modifies
#       message body). Read documentation of each file before using
#       following example
#
#           INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jasubject.rc
#           INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jamime-decode.rc
#           INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jamime-recode.rc

#   Change Log (none)
