#   Description
#
#       This subroutine is part of the MPFS file server.
#       Handle BOUNCES to mail server messages, eg if delivery failed
#       due to maximum byte limit.
#
#           552 <foo@site.com>... Message is too large; 100000 bytes max
#
#   Input
#
#       (none) This recipe examines headers and body to see if it's daemon
#       bounce.
#
#   Output
#
#       o   stat, set to "daemon" if message was handled.
#
#   Change Log (none)

#   Hm, We wouldn't even need the FROM_DAEMON test, because
#   X-Loop is supposed to be unique. Because we expect to see bounce
#   message the original message is included in the body, that's by "B ??"
#   search.
#
#   Handle only some daemon messages, notify the recipient about an error.
