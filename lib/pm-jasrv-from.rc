#   Description
#
#       This subroutine is part of the MPFS file server.
#       Compose headers for reply message using `formail' -rt.
#
#       Here is dry run example to test this module
#
#	    % procmail DEFAULT=/dev/null VERBOSE=on LOGABSTRACT=all         \
#		FORMAIL=/opt/local/bin/formail                              \
#		JA_SRV_FORMAIL_FROM=me@here                                 \
#		JA_SRV_CONTENT_TYPE=content-type                            \
#		JA_SRV_XLOOP=xloop                                          \
#		$HOME/pm/pm-jasrv-from.rc				    \
#	        < $HOME/any-sample.email
#
#   Input
#
#       o   JA_SRV_FORMAIL_FROM, JA_SRV_XLOOP
#       o   JA_SRV_CONTENT_TYPE
#
#   Output
#
#       (none)
#
#   Change Log (none)

dummy = "

#   add initial headers. The MIME headers may
#   very well change later on

dummy = "$id: Preparing reply."

#   This a bit special. When we construct reply to user with formail
#   -rt, the From address would include the address where your
#   server is. That't usually fine.
#
#   But if you have some virtual or `contact' address that you want
#   poeple to use instead of the current address where are, then you
#   want to rewrite the `From' field. Hm. You could also add Reply-To,
#   but suppose you don't want to show the real address at all.
#
#   If you set JA_SRV_FORMAIL_FROM variable, then the email address
#   appears in From field. If you don't define the variable, a normal
#   formail -rt is used.
#
#   Adding "From:" automatically adds From_, get rid of it too
#
#	NOTE: We must put something into `header'; because the above formail
#	fails if the header contains only "". In here we duplicate the
#	harmless call to "-aMessage-ID:"

header  = "-aMessage-ID:"
