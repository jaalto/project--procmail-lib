#   Description
#
#	** THIS MODULE IS OBSOLETE. THE NETMIND SERVICE NO LONGER EXISTS **
#
#       http://minder.netmind.com/
#
#       ...Netmind, or The URL-minder is a free, automatic Web-surfing robot
#       that keeps track of changes to Web pages that are important to you.
#       When the URL-minder detects changes in any of the Web pages you
#       have registered, it sends you e-mail. an effective way to test if
#       the address is known to Internet. You could use this information to
#       see if some automated reply to a address can be sent.
#
#
#       In another words, if you're interested in some URL; say an FAQ page
#       and any updates to them, you can tell Netmind to monitor the page
#       changes for you and it send a message back every time page changes.
#
#       This recipe "pretty formats" the announcement sent by Netmind
#       by stripping the message to bare minimum. You usually aren't interested
#       in 4k message which includes "Note from our sponsors", "Try the free
#       online demo" etc. The things saved from the announcement message are:
#
#       o   The changed url, which is moved to subject
#       o   Cancellation url pointer
#       o   url to the lists of your monitored urls
#       o   your id number
#
#       [Note]
#
#       Please let Netmind send you one "pure" message first so that you
#       have a huch what it originally looks like. Then plug int his module
#       and see how the original message is reduced.
#
#       [Thank you]

#       1998-03-12 send me a patch, where a)body message is more informative
#       b) URL is now included in the body for auto-click browsers c)
#       mime headers were removed.
#
#   Required settings
#
#       PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
#       will include
#
#       o   pm-javar.rc
#       o   If you se variable JA_NETMIND_SUBJECT to "yes", then the changed
#           url http pointer is put to subject line.
#
#   Usage example
#
#           INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-janetmind.rc          # reformat the message
#
#           :0:                                         # drop to folder
#           * netmind
#           url.mbox
#
#   Change Log (none)
