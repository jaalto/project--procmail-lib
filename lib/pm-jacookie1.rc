#
#   Description
#
#       When given a string, this subroutine returns a unique number
#       representing a string, a cookie.
#
#   Required settings
#
#       (none)
#
#   Call arguments (variables to set before calling)
#
#       o   INPUT, String from which the magic-cookie is calculated
#       o   JA_COOKIE_CMD: shell command to read INPUT and return decimal
#           or hex cookie string as one continuous block of characters.
#           It decaults to HP-UX `cksum', but your system may have `md5'
#           or `chksum'
#
#   Return values
#
#       o   Variable OUTPUT will contain the cookie.
#
#   Example usage
#
#           INPUT           = "foo@site.com"
#           JA_COOKIE_CMD   = "md5"     # or chksum
#           INCLUDERC       = $PMSRC/pm-jacookie1.rc
#           cookie          = $OUTPUT
#
#   Change Log: (none)


id    = "pm-jacookie1.rc"
dummy = "

# ........................................................... &input ...

#   This is standard CRC 32

JA_COOKIE_CMD        = ${JA_COOKIE_CMD:-"cksum"}

OUTPUT = `echo $INPUT | $JA_COOKIE_CMD`

#   - We're only interested in the CRC part
