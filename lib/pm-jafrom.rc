#
#   Description
#
#	This includerc extracts the most likely FROM address from the
#       message. The order of the search is Reply-to, From_, Sender, From
#       and if none found, then as a last resort, call `formail'. You would
#       usually use the returned value for logging purposes.
#
#       Avoiding extra formail call could be usefull if you receive lot
#       of messages per day.
#
#       Example input
#
#           (none)
#
#       Returned values
#
#           OUTPUT, containing the derived FROM field
#
#   Required settings
#
#	PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
#       will include pm-javar.rc from there. You nee procmail 3.11pre7 in
#       order to use this subroutine. (due to formail -z switch)
#
#   Call arguments (variables to set before calling)
#
#       (none)
#
#   Usage example
#
#	INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jafrom.rc
#	FROM      = $OUTPUT   # now we have the 'best' FROM field
#
#   Change Log (none)
