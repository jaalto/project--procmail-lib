#   Description
#
#       This simple includerc will define variable BODY_EMPTY to "yes" or
#       "no" when called like this You can file empty messages to separate
#       folder based on this value
#
#           INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jaempty.rc
#
#           :0
#           * BODY_EMPTY ?? yes
#           the-empty-mail-folder
#
#       This is more designed to be part of other modules. If you just want
#       to check for empty message, a simpler recipe like this might be
#       better:
#
#           INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-javar.rc
#
#           :0 B:         # if body has only whitespace characters
#           *$ ! $NSPC
#           the-empty-mail-folder
#
#   Required settings
#
#       (none)
#
#   Change Log (none)

# ............................................................ &init ...

{
    INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-javar.rc
}

# ........................................................... &do-it ...

BODY_EMPTY = "yes"

#   Every empty line or signarure start is a -1
#
#   Every non-empty line that has characters is +10
#
