#
#   Description
#
#	Preserve last N arriving messages in a separate sub-directory.
#	This should be your safety-belt recipe that you put to the beginning
#	of your .procmailrc.
#
#	Procmail saves the backup files with names like: msg.rcG  msg.scG
#	msg.3YS1, msg.4YS1, msg.VYS1, msg.fYS1 to the backup directory.
#
#	Note: this recipe will alawys call shell commands for each message
#       you recive. That is needed because cleaning of the backup directory.
#       If you receive only small number of messages per day, the performance
#       drop of your .procmailrc is not crucial. But if you store many messages
#       per day, then the shell calls may be a performance problem.
#
#       In that case, consider moving the cleanup to the pm-jacron.rc
#       module (The cleanup is run only once a day, not for every message)

#
#   Required settings
#
#       (none)
#
#   Call arguments (variables to set before calling)
#
#       o   JA_BUP_MAX, How many messages to keep at maximum. 32 is default
#       o   JA_BUP_DIR, Where to store the messages. $HOME/Mail/bup by default
#       o   JA_BUP_FILES, regexp to match the saved files. Procmail default.
#       o   JA_BUP_CHECK_DIR. Once you have verified that this recipe works,
#           that directories are ok, please set this flag to "no" to prevent
#           running unnecessary `test' command for each email.
#
#   Usage example
#
#       You only want to keep backup of messages that are not from mailing
#       lists. You may want to use TO_ macro to detect addresses better,
#       this example matches against all headers
#
#           LISTS          = "(procmail|list-1|list-2)"
#           JA_BUP_DIR     = $HOME/Mail/backup/.        # Create the path too
#           JA_BUP_MAX     = 42                         # this should be enough
#

#           {
#               INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jabup.rc
#           }
#
#       If you get many messages, please don't use this module. Instead
#       see pm-jacron.rc where similar backup work is done better.

#   i = ignore write errors
#
#   - The 'rm -f dummy' makes sure that rm always has at least one argument,
#     because there may not be files in the directory.
#   - 'ls -t' returns files sorted by date, newest first
#   - 'sed' just chops first N files from the ls listing, leaving list
#     of old files
#
#   NOTE
#
#   - If you get lot of mail, it is too expensive to run this after
#     every message. Plese use cron(1) or pm-jacron.rc module to run something
#     only once a day.
